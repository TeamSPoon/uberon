The egg proper is closely surrounded by a thick egg envelope, the chorion. The perivitelline space between the chorion and the vitellus is very difficult to recognize using a light microscope. The micropyle located in the chorion at the animal pole is a small trumpet- or funnel-like structure. A number of short villi (non-attaching filaments; average 200.3 +/- 4.7 / egg, n=38) are distributed over the whole surface of the chorion. At spawning, eggs are held together in clumps by a tuft of long attaching filaments (average 29.6 +/- 1.3 / egg, n=38) on the chorion surface in the vegetal pole area of each egg [13]. A large, transparent yolk sphere is located in the center of each unfertilized egg. The cortical alveoli (vesicles, ca. 0.4-45 um in diameter) and oil droplets are embedded at random in the cortical cytoplasm. The cortical alveoli contain a transparent colloidal material and usually one or sometimes a few spherical bodies [16]. The size of the oil droplets usually varies according to differences in the temperature during and after oocyte maturation, in the time after ovulation and among the individual females. -  " [OlatDv:curators]

def: "Zoological Science 11: 825-839 (1994) - 3 min  Stage 1 (3 min) Activated egg stage: When an egg is stimulated by a spermatozoon arriving at the vitelline surface through the micropyle, a transient wave of increase in cytoplasmic free calcium starts at the point of sperm attachment [5,33]. The cortical alveoli in the vicinity of the micropyle also begin to break down (exocytosis of alveolar contents) about 9 sec after sperm attachment [17]. The wave of exocytosis begins to propagate over the whole egg surface and ends at the vegetal pole 154 sec after its beginning. As a result of the exocytosis of cortical alveoli into the narrow space between the chorion and the vitellus, the chorion thins and hardens [24] as it separates from the vitellus to form a wide perivitelline space. Swollen spherical bodies secreted from the cortical alveoli are faintly visible in the perivitelline space. A transient \"contractile wave\" of cortical cytoplasmic layer follows the wave of exocytosis [9,15]. Due to the oscillatory contractions following this distinct contractile wave, the cortical cytoplasm progressively accumulates toward the animal pole to form a thick cytoplasmic layer [1,26]. At 7-8 minutes after sperm entry, the second polar body is extruded onto the surface of the cytoplasm at the center of the area where the germinal vesicle broke down during oocyte maturation. - 3 min " [OlatDv:curators]

comment: It is a misunderstanding that the larval form always reflects the group's evolutionary history. It could be the case, but often the larval stage has evolved secondarily, as in insects. In these cases the larval form might differ more from the group's common origin than the adult form[WP]. Uberon includes clade-specific subclasses.
