comment: Proposed CUMBO def from MM: A subcortical part of the nervous system consisting of a relatively compact group of cells that is distinguishable histologically that share a commonality of cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecturel and connectivity. (comments: I put in "subcortical" because I don't think we consider either the cerebellar cortex or cerebral cortex to be nuclei. Some people distinguish between a nucleus and a laminar structure (see Wikipedia definition). However, there are structures identified as nuclei that are laminar, e.g., lateral geniculate nucleus, although they are not laminated in all species. Also, I put in "relatively compact" and "distiguishable by histology" because we have groups of cells, e.g., cholinergic cell groups, doparminergic cell groups that are related on the 3 criteria but which we don't tend to consider nuclei because they don't occupy an easily defined territory. But all is open to debate.

comment: AO notes: Note that in TAO, ribs are numbered by *vertebrae*.  Taxon notes: In the early tetrapods, every vertebra bore a pair of ribs, although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest. In most subsequent forms, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis. Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals.

Note that this count refers to the total number of teeth starting from the first, regardless of the type of tooth. If sub-systems are required for numbering within a series of teeth of the same type, consider a subproperty. For example, in a human, maxillary canine = tooth 3 of upper jaw = canine_tooth 1 of upper jaw" []
