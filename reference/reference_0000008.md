Abstract
--------
Decisions reached about axial skeleton: bless a 3 level division into cranial, axial and appendicular. here "axial skeleton" refers to what we have been calling "post-cranial axial skeleton" in uberon (and MA). We can still retain what we had been calling "axial skeleton" as a grouping class, but it can be renamed something like "axial skeleton plus cranial skeleton"
