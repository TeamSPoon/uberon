NEW: An artery that supplies blood to the lower urinary bladder.


UBERON:0001312 : superior vesical artery   
OLD: The superior vesical artery supplies numerous branches to the upper part of the bladder. From one of these a slender vessel, the artery to the ductus deferens, takes origin and accompanies the duct in its course to the testis, where it anastomoses with the internal spermatic artery. Other branches supply the ureter. The first part of the superior vesical artery represents the terminal section of the previous portion of the umbilical artery. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: An artery that supplies blood to the upper urinary bladder.


UBERON:0001324 : common fibular nerve   
OLD: A nerve arising at the terminal division of the sciatic nerve at the popliteal fossa and extending to the neck of the fibula, ultimately innervating the Peroneus muscle[MP]. The common peroneal nerve (common fibular nerve; external popliteal nerve; peroneal nerve), about one-half the size of the tibial nerve, is derived from the dorsal branches of the fourth and fifth lumbar and the first and second sacral nerves. It descends obliquely along the lateral side of the popliteal fossa to the head of the fibula, close to the medial margin of the biceps femoris muscle. It lies between the tendon of the biceps femoris and lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle, winds around the neck of the fibula, between the peron√¶us longus and the bone, and divides beneath the muscle into the superficial peroneal nerve (superficial fibular nerve) and deep peroneal nerve (deep fibular nerve). [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A nerve arising at the terminal division of the sciatic nerve at the popliteal fossa and extending to the neck of the fibula, ultimately innervating the Peroneus muscle[MP].


UBERON:0001414 : median basilic vein   
(was median cubital vein)
OLD: In human anatomy, the median cubital vein (or median basilic vein) a superficial vein of the upper limb. It connects the basilic and cephalic vein and is often used for venipuncture (taking blood). It lies in the cubital fossa superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis. There exists a fair amount of variation of the median cubital vein. More commonly the vein forms an H-pattern with the cephalic and basilic veins making up the sides. Other forms include an M-pattern, where the vein branches to the cephalic and basilic veins. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A vein between the biceps and pronator radii teres muscles that unites with the common ulnar vein to form the basilic vein within the forearm.


UBERON:0001494 : ulnar nerve   
OLD: In human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve which runs near the ulna bone. The ulnar nerve is the largest unprotected nerve in the human body (meaning, unprotected by muscle or bone), and the only unprotected nerve that does not serve a purely sensory function (those nerves specifically meant to perceive changes in the environment, such as nerves in the skin). This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, supplying the palmar side of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A nerve which runs near the ulna bone.

UBERON:0008810 : nasopalatine nerve   
OLD: One branch of the posterior superior nasal branches (trigeminal, maxillary branch), longer and larger than the others, is named the nasopalatine nerve (sometimes called the long sphenopalatine nerve). It enters the nasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen, passes across the roof of the nasal cavity below the orifice of the sphenoidal sinus to reach the septum, and then runs obliquely downward and forward between the periosteum and mucous membrane of the lower part of the septum. It descends to the roof of the mouth through the incisive canal and communicates with the corresponding nerve of the opposite side and with the greater palatine nerve. It supplies the palatal structures around the upper central and lateral incisors and the canines (the upper front six teeth). It also furnishes a few filaments to the mucous membrane of the nasal septum. The medial superior posterior nasal branches of maxillary nerve usually branches from the nasopalatine nerve.
NEW: A branch of that maxillary nerve that innervates the mucous membrane of the hard palate.


UBERON:0008833 : great auricular nerve

OLD: One of the canals of the orbital surface of the maxilla, the infraorbital canal, opens just below the margin of the orbit.
NEW: A canal through the maxilla that is connects the infra-orbital groove and foramen and is the conduit for the passage of the infraorbital nerve and artery.


UBERON:0011321 : masseteric nerve   
OLD: The masseteric nerve passes laterally, above the Pterygoideus externus, in front of the temporomandibular articulation, and behind the tendon of the Temporalis; it crosses the mandibular notch with the masseteric artery, to the deep surface of the Masseter, in which it ramifies nearly as far as its anterior border. It gives a filament to the temporomandibular joint.
NEW: A muscular branch of the mandibular nerve passing to the medial surface of the masseter muscle, which it innervates.


UBERON:0013222 : otic notch   
OLD: Otic notches are invagination in the posterior margin of the skull roof, one behind each orbit. Such notches are found in labyrinthodonts and some of their immediate ancestors, but not their reptilian descendants. The presence or absence of the otic notches is one of the traits used to separate the amniotes from the amphibian grade tetrapods. The notches have been interpreted as part of an auditory structure, and are often shown holding a tympanum similar to those seen in modern anurans. Analysis of the columella (the stapes in amphibians and reptiles) of labyrinthodonts however indicate it did not function in transmitting low energy vibrations, thus rendering them effectively deaf to airborne sound. The otic notch instead functioned as a spiracle, at least in the early forms.
NEW: Otic notches are invagination in the posterior margin of the skull roof, one behind each orbit. Such notches are found in labyrinthodonts and some of their immediate ancestors, but not their reptilian descendants. The presence or absence of the otic notches is one of the traits used to separate the amniotes from the amphibian grade tetrapods.


UBERON:0013647 : lateral pterygoid nerve   
OLD: External Pterygoid Nerve (or lateral pterygoid nerve): The nerve to the Pterygoideus externus frequently arises in conjunction with the buccinator nerve, but it may be given off separately from the anterior division of the mandibular nerve. It enters the deep surface of the muscle.

UBERON:0018409 : infra-orbital groove of maxilla   
(was infra-orbital groove)
OLD: Near the middle of the posterior part of the orbital surface of the maxilla is the infraorbital groove (or sulcus), for the passage of the infraorbital vessels and nerve. The groove begins at the middle of the posterior border, where it is continuous with that near the upper edge of the infratemporal surface, and, passing forward, ends in a canal, which subdivides into two branches.
NEW: A groove on the interior of the maxilla that is continuous with the infra-orbital canal and is the conduit for the passage of the infraorbital nerve and artery.


UBERON:0018412 : vidian nerve   
OLD: A nerve that is formed by the junction of the great petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve in the cartilaginous substance which fills the foramen lacerum. It passes forward, through the pterygoid canal, with the corresponding artery, and is joined by a small ascending sphenoidal branch from the otic ganglion. Finally, it enters the pterygopalatine fossa, and joins the posterior angle of the pterygopalatine ganglion. It contains preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the greater petrosal nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), and postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the deep petrosal nerve.
NEW: A nerve that is formed by the junction of the great petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve and continues on to innervate the palate, nose and lacrimal gland.


UBERON:0019197 : dorsal nerve of penis   
OLD: The dorsal nerve of the penis is the deepest division of the pudendal nerve; it accompanies the internal pudendal artery along the ramus of the ischium; it then runs forward along the margin of the inferior ramus of the pubis, between the superior and inferior layers of the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. Piercing the inferior layer it gives a branch to the corpus cavernosum penis, and passes forward, in company with the dorsal artery of the penis, between the layers of the suspensory ligament, on to the dorsum of the penis, and ends on the glans penis.
NEW: The deep terminal division of the pudendal nerve that runs along the dorsum of the penis and innervates the the corpus cavernosum penis, the prepuce and the glans penis.

UBERON:0022301 : long ciliary nerve   
OLD: The long ciliary nerves, two or three in number, are given off from the nasociliary, as it crosses the optic nerve. They accompany the short ciliary nerves from the ciliary ganglion, pierce the posterior part of the sclera, and running forward between it and the choroid, are distributed to the iris and cornea. The long ciliary nerves provide sensory innervation to the eyeball. In addition, they contain sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion to the dilator pupillC& muscle. The sympathetic fibers to the dilator pupillae muscle mainly travel in the nasociliary nerve but there are also sympathetic fibers in the short ciliary nerves that pass through the ciliary ganglion without forming synapses.
NEW:  A branch of the nasociliary nerve that innervates the ciliary muscles, the iris, and the cornea.


UBERON:0022302 : short ciliary nerve   
OLD: The branches of the ciliary ganglion are the short ciliary nerves. These are delicate filaments, from six to ten in number, which arise from the forepart of the ganglion in two bundles connected with its superior and inferior angles; the lower bundle is the larger. They run forward with the ciliary arteries in a wavy course, one set above and the other below the optic nerve, and are accompanied by the long ciliary nerves from the nasociliary. They pierce the sclera at the back part of the bulb of the eye, pass forward in delicate grooves on the inner surface of the sclera, and are distributed to the Ciliaris muscle, iris, and cornea. The short ciliary nerve contains parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers. The parasympathetics arise from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and synapse in the ciliary ganglion via the oculomotor nerve, the postganglionic parasympathetics leave the ciliary ganglion in the short ciliary nerve and supply the ciliary body and iris. Sympathetics are provided by the superior cervical ganglion and they reach the ganglion either as branches of the nasociliary nerve or directly from the extension of the plexus on the ophthalmic artery (sympathetic branch to ciliary ganglion). Damage to the short ciliary nerve may result in loss of the pupillary light reflex, or mydriasis.
NEW:  A branch of the ciliary ganglion that innervates the ciliary muscles, the iris, and the tunics of the eyeball.
