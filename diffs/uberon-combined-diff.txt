UBERON:0001149 : bare area of liver   
OLD: The coronary ligaments represent reflections of the visceral peritoneum covering the liver onto the diaphragm. As such, between the two layers of the coronary ligament there is a large triangular surface of the liver devoid of peritoneal covering; this is named the bare area of the liver, and is attached to the diaphragm by areolar tissue. The bare area of the liver is still covered by Glisson's capsule, the fibrous capsule that sheathes the entire liver.
NEW: A large triangular surface of the liver devoid of peritoneal covering.


UBERON:0001644 : trochlear nerve   
OLD: Cranial nerve that runs to the eye muscles.
NEW: A cranial nerve that runs to the eye muscles.


UBERON:0002003 : peripheral nerve   
OLD: Neural tree (organ) which is directly continuous with the neuraxis. Examples: phrenic nerve, radial nerve, ilioinguinal nerve, sciatic nerve[FMA]. The peripheral nerves include the 12 cranial nerves, the spinal nerves and roots, and what are called the autonomic nerves that are concerned specifically with the regulation of the heart muscle, the muscles in blood vessel walls, and glands[BTO]. The nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, including the autonomic, cranial, and spinal nerves. Peripheral nerves contain non-neuronal cells and connective tissue as well as axons. The connective tissue layers include, from the outside to the inside, the epineurium, the perineurium, and the endoneurium[GAID]. A peripheral nerve, or simply nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of peripheral axons (the long, slender projections of neurons). A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons. Nerves are found only in the peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts[WP].

UBERON:0002194 : capsule of lymph node   
OLD: Capsule surrounding lymph node composed of connective tissue with some plain muscle fibers. from its internal surface are given off a number of membranous processes or trabeculae, consisting, in man, of connective tissue, with a small admixture of plain muscle fibers; but in many of the lower animals composed almost entirely of involuntary muscle[WP].
NEW: Capsule surrounding lymph node composed of connective tissue with some plain muscle fibers.


UBERON:0002395 : talus   
OLD: proximal tarsal bone resulting from fusion of intermedium and fibulare.
NEW: A proximal tarsal bone resulting from fusion of intermedium and fibulare.


UBERON:0003090 : supraorbital lateral line   
OLD: One of eight distinct lateral lines in the 4-day larva. A sensory system on the surface of the fish, consisting of small sensory patches (neuromasts) distributed in discrete lines over the body surface. The lateral line system is stimulated by local water displacements and vibrations, and detects propulsion of the fish through the water, as well as facilitating shoaling, prey capture, and predator and obstacle avoidance.
NEW: The lateral line that is located above the eye.


UBERON:0003092 : ultimobranchial body   
OLD: Pharyngeal pouch derivative, usually paired cell masses located in the neck region[Kardong]. The ultimobranchial body or gland is a small organ found in the neck region of many animals.
NEW: An outpocketing of one of the caudal pharyngeal pouches that is comprised on calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells.


UBERON:0003094 : infraorbital lateral line   
OLD: One of eight distinct lateral lines in the 4-day larva. A sensory system on the surface of the fish, consisting of small sensory patches (neuromasts) distributed in discrete lines over the body surface. The lateral line system is stimulated by local water displacements and vibrations, and detects propulsion of the fish through the water, as well as facilitating shoaling, prey capture, and predator and obstacle avoidance.
NEW: The lateral line that is located below the eye.


UBERON:0003095 : dorsal lateral line   
OLD: One of eight distinct lateral lines in the 4-day larva. A sensory system on the surface of the fish, consisting of small sensory patches (neuromasts) distributed in discrete lines over the body surface. The lateral line system is stimulated by local water displacements and vibrations, and detects propulsion of the fish through the water, as well as facilitating shoaling, prey capture, and predator and obstacle avoidance.
NEW: A lateral line that is located in the dorsal part of the organism.


UBERON:0003383 : cardiac muscle tissue of interventricular septum   
(was cardiac muscle of interventricular septum)
OLD: A portion of cardiac muscle tissue that is part of a interventricular septum [Automatically generated definition].
NEW: A portion of cardiac muscle tissue that is part of an interventricular septum [Automatically generated definition].


UBERON:0005463 : subcapsular sinus of lymph node   
(was marginal sinus of lymph node)
OLD: bowl-shaped lymph sinuses separating the capsule from the cortical parenchyma, and from which lymph flows into the cortical sinuses.
NEW: A space between the capsule and the cortex which allows the free movement of lymphatic fluid and so contains a sparsity of lymphocytes. It is continuous with the similar lymph sinuses that flank the trabeculae.


UBERON:0010398 : spleen marginal sinus   
OLD: The border region surrounding the spleen B cell follicles and the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) that separates it from the marginal zone that mediates lymphocyte entry into the white pulp from the blood
NEW: The border region surrounding the spleen B cell follicles and the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath that separates it from the marginal zone that mediates lymphocyte entry into the white pulp from the blood


UBERON:0010853 : capitulum of humerus   
OLD: In human anatomy of the arm, the lateral portion of the articular surface of the humerus consists of a smooth, rounded eminence, named the capitulum of the humerus. It articulates with the cupshaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone..
NEW: A smooth, rounded eminence on the lateral portion of the articular surface of the humerus. It articulates with the cupshaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone.


UBERON:0012126 : fibulare   
OLD: One of two element that constitute the basal row of tarsals. The fibulare constitutes the preaxial element[AAO].
NEW: One of two elements that constitute the basal row of tarsals. The fibulare constitutes the preaxial element[AAO].


UBERON:0016479 : capsule of liver   
(was fibrous capsule of liver)
OLD: Glisson's capsule is a collagenous capsule covering the external surface of the liver. It is covered by a single layer of mesothelial cells. A capsule for fibrous cells or tissues, as that surrounding the kidney and thyroid. It is named for Francis Glisson.
NEW: A collagenous capsule covering the external surface of the liver.
