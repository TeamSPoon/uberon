UBERON:0000087 : inner cell mass   
OLD: Mass of cells inside the primordial embryo that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the fetus. This structure forms in the earliest steps of development, before implantation into the endometrium of the uterus has occurred. The ICM lies within the blastocoele (more correctly termed 'blastocyst cavity', as it is not strictly homologous to the blastocoele of anamniote vertebrates) and is entirely surrounded by the single layer of cells called trophoblast.

Although the original designation was anatomical, the limbic system has come to be associated with the system in the brain subserving emotional functions. As such, it is very poorly defined and doesn't correspond closely to the anatomical meaning any longer. [BirnLex]. including the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, and limbic cortex, which support a variety of functions including emotion, behavior, long term memory, and olfaction [Wikipedia].

UBERON:0001153 : caecum   
OLD: Pouch, connecting the ileum with the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve, and is the beginning of the large intestine. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction.
NEW: A pouch in the digestive tract that connects the ileum with the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve, and is the beginning of the large intestine. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction.


UBERON:0001155 : colon   
OLD: Last portion of the digestive system in most vertebrates; it extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body[WP] In mammals, the colon consists of four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon[WP]. In zebrafish, the posterior intestine has short longitudinally arranged epithelial folds which are similar to the colon of higher vertebrates[ZFIN].
NEW: Last portion of the large intestine before it becomes the rectum.


UBERON:0001156 : ascending colon   
OLD: Organ part which is continuous with the cecum proximally and the transverse colon distally.[FMA]
NEW: Segment of the colon which is continuous with the cecum proximally and the transverse colon distally.[FMA,modified]


UBERON:0001157 : transverse colon   
OLD: The transverse colon the longest and most movable part of the colon, passes with a downward convexity from the right hypochondrium region across the abdomen, opposite the confines of the epigastric and umbilical zones, into the left hypochondrium region, where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen, forming the splenic or left colic flexure. The right colic flexure is adjacent to the liver. In its course, it describes an arch, the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward; toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve. It is almost completely invested by peritoneum, and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane, the transverse mesocolon. It is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver and gall-bladder, the greater curvature of the stomach, and the lower end of the spleen; by its under surface, with the small intestine; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the greater omentum and the abdominal parietes; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The segment of colon that runs transversely across the upper part of the abdomen, from the right to the left colic flexure. Continuous with the descending colon.


UBERON:0001158 : descending colon   
OLD: The descending colon of humans passes downward through the left hypochondrium and lumbar regions, along the lateral border of the left kidney. At the lower end of the kidney it turns medialward toward the lateral border of the psoas muscle, and then descends, in the angle between psoas and quadratus lumborum, to the crest of the ilium, where it ends in the sigmoid colon. The peritoneum covers its anterior surface and sides, and therefore the descending colon is described as retroperitoneal. (The transverse colon and sigmoid colon, which are immediately proximal and distal, are intraperitoneal). Its posterior surface is connected by areolar tissue with the lower and lateral part of the left kidney, the aponeurotic origin of the transversus abdominis, and the quadratus lumborum. It is smaller in caliber and more deeply placed than the ascending colon. It has a mesentery in 33% of people, and is therefore more frequently covered with peritoneum on its posterior surface than the ascending colon (which has a mesentery in 25% of people). However, it is less likely to undergo volvulus than the ascending colon. In front of it are some coils of small intestine. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The portion of the colon between the left colic flexure and the sigmoid colon at the pelvic brim; the portion of the descending colon lying in the left iliac fossa is sometimes called the iliac colon.


UBERON:0001254 : urothelium of ureter   
OLD: The luminal epithelium of the tube that conducts the urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder[MP,unvetted]
NEW: The luminal epithelium of the tube that conducts the urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder[MP]

NEW: One of two jugular veins that collect the blood from the brain, the superficial parts of the face, and the neck. [WP,unvetted].


UBERON:0002154 : lateral reticular nucleus   
OLD: The lateral reticular nucleus, of the funiculus, can be divided into three subnuclei, the parvocellular, magnocellular and the subtrigeminal. As is typical of the reticular formation, none of these are very distinct subnuclei, but rather blurred distinctions between cell types and location. The lateral reticular nucleus sends all of its projections to the cerebellum. The parvocellular portion of the LRN and the immediately adjacent magnocellular portion send most their projections to the vermis of the cerebellum. The rest of the magnocellular subnucleus sends its projections to the hemisphere regions of the cerebellum. The subtrigeminal nucleus sends its projections to the flocculonodular lobe. All of these efferent pathways are projected in an ipsilateral manner to the cerebellum, the most abundant of which are those to the vermis. This nucleus is also involved in the mediation of inspiration (in-breathing) with a part of the ventral r. nucleus. The afferent pathways to the LRN come from the spinal cord and higher brain structures. Most of the afferents come from the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord and project exclusively to the parts of the LRN that do not receive input from the cortex. The spinal cord projections terminate mostly in the parvocellular region along with the adjacent magnocellular cells. This implies that most input from the spinal cord is relayed into the vermis. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A nucleus of the lateral medullary nuclear complex.


UBERON:0002424 : oral epithelium   
OLD: Epithelium that is part of the mouth and lines the oral cavity, typically stratified squamous, and may be para-, ortho- or non- keratinized. Primary barrier between oral environment and deeper tissues

UBERON:0003222 : flexor digitorum superficialis   
OLD: An extrinsic flexor muscle of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints. The muscle has two classically described heads - the humeroulnar and radial - and it is between these heads that the median nerve and ulnar artery pass. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint gives its origin to part of this muscle. The primary function of flexor digitorum superficialis is flexion of the middle phalanges of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints, however under continued action it also flexes the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrist joint[WP].
NEW: An extrinsic flexor muscle of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints.[WP].


UBERON:0003669 : fascia lata

OLD: Any one of the several large veins of the neck that drain blood from the head[BTO]. Veins in the neck which drain the brain, face, and neck into the brachiocephalic or subclavian veins[GAID]. The jugular veins are veins that bring deoxygenated blood from the head back to the heart via the superior vena cava[WP].
NEW: The jugular veins are veins that bring deoxygenated blood from the head back to the heart via the superior vena cava.


UBERON:0005302 : female preputial gland   
OLD: The paired, lobulated, modified sebaceous glands located on the side of the clitoris in female rodents; in contrast to the preputial glands in male rodents, clitoral glands are a minor source of olfactory stimuli contributing to sexual attractivity; unlike other sebaceous glands, they undergo progressive atrophy of the glandular portion with marked ductal ectasia as rodents age; .

NEW: A naris that provides one of the small external openings of the head that give passage to air for breathing.


UBERON:0006973 : protonephridium   
OLD: A network of dead-end tubules lacking internal openings found in the Phylums Platyhelminthes, kinorhyncha and Rotifera. The ends are called flame cells (if cilliated) or solenocytes (if flagellated); they function in osmoregulation and ionoregulation. The terminal cells are located at the blind end of the protonephridium. Each cell has one or more cilia and their beating inside the protonephridial tube creates an outward going current and hence a partial pressurization in the blind of the tube. Because of this pressurization drives waste fluids from the inside of the animal, they are pulled through small perforations in the terminal cells and into the protonephridium. The perforations in the terminal cell are large enough for small molecules to pass, but larger proteins are retained within the animal. From the bottom of the protonephridium the solutes are led through the tube, formed by the canal cells, and exits the animal from a small opening formed by the nephridiopore. Selective reabsorption of useful molecules by the canal cells occurs as the solutes pass down the tubule. Protonephridia are generally found in basal organisms such as flatworms. Protonephridia likely first arose as a way to cope with a hypotonic environment by removing excess water from the organism (osmoregulation). Their use as excretory/ionoregulatory structures likely arose secondarily.
NEW: A network of dead-end tubules lacking internal openings found in the Phylums Platyhelminthes, kinorhyncha and Rotifera.


UBERON:0007347 : hyperpallium   
OLD: Birds have a unique pallial structure known as the hyperpallium, once called the hyperstriatum.
NEW: A pallial structure uniqut to avians.


UBERON:0007350 : arcopallium   
OLD: The arcopallium refers to regions of the avian brain which partially overlap regions homologous to the amygdala of mammals. These regions have formerly been referred to as archistriatum, and before this epistriatum or amygdaloid complex, and a recent change of nomenclature has divided the region into the arcopallium and posterior pallial amygdala. The new nomenclature, adopted in 2004, reflects a modern understanding that the avian brain is broadly similar to the mammalian brain, containing large regions homologous to the mammalian neocortex, claustrum, and pallial amygdala. The outdated nomenclature it replaced perceived the avian brain as consisting almost entirely of enlarged basal ganglia, to which more complex outer layers had been added during a progress toward mammalian intelligence.
NEW: A pallial region found in avias that  partially overlap regions homologous to the amygdala of mammals.


UBERON:0007764 : paramedian reticular nucleus   
OLD: The paramedian reticular nucleus (in Terminologia Anatomica, or paramedian medullary reticular group in NeuroNames) sends its connections to the spinal cord in a mostly ipsilateral manner, although there is some decussation. It projects to the vermis in the anterior lobe, the pyramis and the uvula. The paramedian nucleus also projects to the contralateral PRN, the gigantocellular nucleus, and the nucleus ambiguous. The paramedian reticular formation is adjacent to the abducens (VI)nucleus in the pons and adjacent to the oculomotor nucleus(III) in the midbrain. The paramedian nucleus receives afferents mostly from the fastigial nucleus in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex; however, the projections from the spinal cord are very sparse. The descending afferent connections come mostly from the frontal and parietal lobes; however the pontine reticular formation also sends projections to the paramedian reticular nucleus. There are also very sparse innervations from the superior colliculus. Lesions in the paramedian reticular nucleus have been shown to cause a stereotyped increase in the random patterns of motion in rats. The paramedian nuclei on either side of the brain stem have been shown to mediate the horizontal eye movements on their ipsilateral sides. It seems possible that that the random motion patterns of the above rats were caused by an inability to mediate their horizontal eye movements.
NEW: A medullary nucleus that sends its connections to the spinal cord in a mostly ipsilateral manner.


UBERON:0007805 : synsacrum   
OLD: The synsacrum is a skeletal structure, mainly described in birds and dinosaurs, in which the sacrum is extended by incorporation of additional fused or partially-fused caudal or lumbar vertebrae. The ilium of the pelvis is attached to the synsacrum and, in some species, may also be fused to it. Together with the pelvis this forms a rigid structure which carries the weight of the hind end of the animal. In living and some prehistoric birds, posterior to the synsacrum there are usually only a few free caudal vertebrae, on the end of which lies the pygostyle[WP]. Complex of synostotically fused vertebrae supporting the pelvic girdle. In anurans, the synsacrum is formed by two vertebrae and the urostyle is fused to its posterior end[AAO].
NEW: A region of the lower vertebral column formed from the fusion of vertebrae.


UBERON:0008193 : pneumatized bone   
OLD: A bone that is hollow or contains many air cells, such as the mastoid process of the temporal bone[TMD]. Skeletal pneumaticity is the presence of air spaces within bones. Skeletal pneumaticity exists only in synapsids and archosaurs. It is generally produced during development by excavation of bone by pneumatic diverticula (air sacs) from an air-filled space such as the lungs or nasal cavity. Pneumatization is highly variable between individuals, and bones not normally pneumatized can become pneumatized in pathological development. Pneumatization occurs in the skulls of mammals, crocodilians and birds among extant groups, as well as extinct archosaurs including the dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Pneumatic spaces include the paranasal sinuses and some of the mastoid cells[WP].
NEW: A bone that is hollow or contains many air cells, such as the mastoid process of the temporal bone[TMD].

NEW: The Skene's ducts are a pair of ducts leading from the Skene's glands to the surface of the vulva, to the left and right of the urethral opening.


UBERON:0010391 : parametrium   
OLD: In women, the supravaginal portion of the cervix is separated in front from the bladder by fibrous tissue, the parametrium, which extends also on to its sides and laterally between the layers of the broad ligaments. The uterine artery and ovarian ligament are located in the parametrium. Inflammation causes Parametritis.
NEW: The subserous connective tissue of the pelvic floor of the supracervical portion of the uterus. The parametrium extends laterally between the layers of the broad ligament.


UBERON:0010994 : coronoid process of ulna   
OLD: The coronoid process is a triangular eminence projecting forward from the upper and front part of the ulna. Its base is continuous with the body of the bone, and of considerable strength. Its apex is pointed, slightly curved upward, and in flexion of the forearm is received into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. Its upper surface is smooth, concave, and forms the lower part of the semilunar notch. Its antero-inferior surface is concave, and marked by a rough impression for the insertion of the Brachialis muscle. At the junction of this surface with the front of the body is a rough eminence, the tuberosity of the ulna, which gives insertion to a part of the Brachialis; to the lateral border of this tuberosity the oblique cord is attached. Its lateral surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the radial notch. Its medial surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment of part of the ulnar collateral ligament. At the front part of this surface is a small rounded eminence for the origin of one head of the Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle; behind the eminence is a depression for part of the origin of the Flexor digitorum profundus muscle; descending from the eminence is a ridge which gives origin to one head of the Pronator teres muscle. Frequently, the Flexor pollicis longus muscle arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle of muscular fibers.
NEW: A a triangular eminence projecting forward from the proximal epiphysis of the ulna[WP,modified].


UBERON:0011237 : visceral fascia   
OLD: Visceral fascia suspends the organs within their cavities and wraps them in layers of connective tissue membranes. Each of the organs is covered in a double layer of fascia; these layers are separated by a thin serous membrane. The outermost wall of the organ is known as the parietal layer The skin of the organ is known as the visceral layer. The organs have specialized names for their visceral fasciae. In the brain, they are known as meninges; in the heart they are known as pericardia; in the lungs, they are known as pleura; and in the abdomen, they are known as peritonea.
NEW: Fascia that suspends a visceral organ.


UBERON:0011627 : orbital part of frontal bone   
OLD: The orbital or horizontal part of the frontal bone (pars orbitalis) consists of two thin triangular plates, the orbital plates, which form the vaults of the orbits, and are separated from one another by a median gap, the ethmoidal notch.
NEW: A zone of the frontal bone that consists of two thin triangular plates, the orbital plates, which form the vaults of the orbits, and are separated from one another by a median gap, the ethmoidal notch.


UBERON:0012118 : infraspinatus tendon   
OLD: The infraspinatus muscle inserts at this tendon to the distal greater tubercle of the humerus . This tendon stretches across the shoulder joint to attach to the humerus and in doing so acts as a very strong ligament to hold the joint surface in apposition. This structure restricts the movement of the shoulder joint to flexion and extension (together with the suscapularis tendon and the supraspinatus tendon). A bursa lies under this tendon at the greater tubercle of the humerus. The bursa is lined by a synovial membrance and filled with synovial fluid and protects the infraspinatus tendon and the shoulder joint by allowing the transmissions of tension and sheer forces around an angle.

NEW: One of two rows of feathers encircling the cloaca


UBERON:0013767 : frontal process of maxilla   
OLD: The frontal process of the maxilla (nasal process) is a strong plate, which projects upward, medialward, and backward, by the side of the nose, forming part of its lateral boundary. Its lateral surface is smooth, continuous with the anterior surface of the body, and gives attachment to the Quadratus labii superioris, the Orbicularis oculi, and the medial palpebral ligament. Its medial surface forms part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity; at its upper part is a rough, uneven area, which articulates with the ethmoid, closing in the anterior ethmoidal cells; below this is an oblique ridge, the ethmoidal crest, the posterior end of which articulates with the middle nasal concha, while the anterior part is termed the agger nasi; the crest forms the upper limit of the atrium of the middle meatus. The upper border articulates with the frontal bone and the anterior with the nasal; the posterior border is thick, and hollowed into a groove, which is continuous below with the lacrimal groove on the nasal surface of the body: by the articulation of the medial margin of the groove with the anterior border of the lacrimal a corresponding groove on the lacrimal is brought into continuity, and together they form the lacrimal fossa for the lodgement of the lacrimal sac. The lateral margin of the groove is named the anterior lacrimal crest, and is continuous below with the orbital margin; at its junction with the orbital surface is a small tubercle, the lacrimal tubercle, which serves as a guide to the position of the lacrimal sac.
NEW: A plate of bone from the maxilla that that projects upward, medialward, and backward, by the side of the nose, forming part of its lateral boundary[WP,modified].
