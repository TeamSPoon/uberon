UBERON:0002270 : hyaloid artery   
OLD: The hyaloid artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which is itself a branch of the internal carotid artery. It is contained within the optic stalk of the eye and extends from the optic disc through the vitreous humor to the lens. Usually fully regressed before birth, its purpose is to supply nutrient to the developing lens in the growing fetus. During the tenth week of development in humans (time varies depending on species), the lens grows independent of a blood supply and the hyaloid artery usually regresses. Its proximal portion remains as the central artery of the retina. Regression of the hyaloid artery leaves a clear central zone through the vitreous called the hyaloid canal or Cloquet's canal. . Occasionally the artery may not fully regress, resulting in the condition persistent hyaloid artery. More commonly, small remnants of the artery may remain. Free remnants can sometimes be seen as 'floaters'. An anterior remnant of the hyaloid artery can be seen in some people as Mittendorf's dot, a small pinpoint-like scar on the posterior surface of the lens. A posterior remnant may be seen where the artery left the optic disc, and is known as Bergmeister's papilla.

UBERON:0006010 : hyaloid canal   
OLD: Hyaloid canal is a small transparent canal running through the vitreous body from the optical nerve disc to the lens; in foetus it contains a prolongation of the central artery of the retina, the hyaloid artery. Other names: Cloquet's canal, Stilling's canal. The function of the canal is to provide an adjustable reservoir of mobile liquid which may be easily and rapidly displaced backwards in positive accommodation, forwards in negative accommodation[WP]. a passage running from in front of the optic disk to the lens of the eye; in the fetus, it transmits the hyaloid artery[TFD].
NEW: A small transparent canal running through the vitreous body from the optical nerve disc to the lens. It is formed by an invagination of the hyaloid, a membrane which encloses the vitreous body[WP].
