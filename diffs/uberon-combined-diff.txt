UBERON:0000020 : sense organ   
OLD: An organ that is capable of detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell.
NEW: An organ that is capable of detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception.


UBERON:0000022 : feather   
OLD: one of the epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. Feathers are formed in tiny follicles in the epidermis, or outer skin layer, that produce keratin proteins. The β-keratins in feathers, beaks and claws — and the claws, scales and shells of reptiles — are composed of protein strands hydrogen-bonded into β-pleated sheets, which are then further twisted and crosslinked by disulfide bridges into structures even tougher than the α-keratins of mammalian hair, horns and hoof. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known but it has been found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.

UBERON:0000038 : follicular fluid   
OLD: The fluid surrounding the OVUM and GRANULOSA CELLS in the Graafian follicle ( OVARIAN FOLLICLE). The follicular fluid contains sex steroids, glycoprotein hormones, plasma proteins, mucopolysaccharides, and enzymes.
NEW: The fluid surrounding the ovum and granulosa cells in the ovarian follicle..


UBERON:0000080 : mesonephros   
OLD: In mammals, the mesonephros is the second of the three embryonic kidneys to be established and exists only transiently. In lower vertebrates such as fish and amphibia, the mesonephros will form the mature kidney[GO]. One of three excretory organs that develop in vertebrates. It serves as the main excretory organ of aquatic vertebrates and as a temporary kidney in higher vertebrates. composed of the mesonephric duct (also called the Wolffian duct), mesonephric tubules, and associated capillary tufts. A single tubule and its associated capillary tuft is called a mesonephric excretory unit; these units are similar in structure and function to nephrons of the adult kidney. The mesonephros is derived from intermediate mesoderm in the vertebrate embryo.

UBERON:0000915 : thoracic segment of trunk   
OLD: Organismal subdivision of body that lies between the head and the abdomen [Wikipedia].
NEW: Subdivision of trunk that lies between the head and the abdomen.


UBERON:0000916 : abdomen   
OLD: In vertebrates such as mammals the abdomen (belly) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis. The region enclosed by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity.
NEW: The subdivision of the vertebrate body between the thorax and pelvis. The ventral part of the abdomen contains the abdominal cavity and visceral organs. The dorsal part includes the abdominal section of the vertebral column.


UBERON:0001597 : masseter muscle   
OLD: jaw muscle of therapsids which permits the longitudinal, grinding, motions of the jaw.  The masseter is derived from the m. adductor mandibulae externus, which originates in the adductor chamber (in the temporal fenestra) and inserts on the coronoid process and internal surface of the lower jaw.[Palaeos].
NEW: Pharyngeal arch 1 muscle that participates in oral/pharyngeal behaviors, is innervated by masseteric nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), and attaches to mandible and zygomatic arch.


UBERON:0002055 : zona reticularis of adrenal gland   
OLD: The zona reticularis is the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, lying deep to the zona fasciculata and superficial to the adrenal medulla. The cells are arranged cords that project in different directions giving a net-like appearance (L. reticulum - net). Cells in the zona reticularis produce precursor androgens including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione from cholesterol. DHEA is further converted to DHEA-sulfate via a sulfotransferase, SULT2A1. These precursors are not further converted in the adrenal cortex as the cells lack 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Instead, they are released into the blood stream and taken up in the testis and ovaries to produce testosterone and the estrogens respectively. In some animals like rodents, the reticularis layer does contain 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which along with other enzymes present results in the production of corticosteroids like the fasciculata. In rodents too, the lack of 17alpha-hydroxylase results in the synthesis of corticosterone instead of cortisol as in the human. [WP,unvetted].

UBERON:0002581 : postcentral gyrus   
OLD: The lateral postcentral gyrus is a prominent structure in the parietal lobe of the human brain and an important landmark. It was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of Penfield, and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2, more recent work by Kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as 'primary somatosensory cortex', as it received the bulk of the thalamocortical projection from the sensory input fields. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: Component of the parietal lobe. The appearance and disappearance of the central sulcus were the rostral and caudal boundaries of the postcentral gyrus respectively. The medial and lateral boundaries were the lateral bank of the precentral gyrus and the lateral fissure and/or the medial bank of the superior parietal gyrus respectively (Christine Fennema-Notestine).


UBERON:0003942 : somatic sensory system   
OLD: The neural tissue involved in the transmission of sensory signals
NEW: The sensory system for the sense of touch and pain.


UBERON:0006719 : lateral pterygoid muscle   
OLD: The lateral pterygoid (or external pterygoid) is a muscle of mastication with two heads.
NEW: Pharyngeal arch 1 muscle that participates in oral/pharyngeal behaviors, is innervated by the lateral pterygoid nerve branches, and attaches to the condylar process of the mandible and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) capsule, and the cranial base.


UBERON:0008598 : risorius muscle   
OLD: The risorius arises in the fascia over the parotid gland and, passing horizontally forward, superficial to the platysma, inserts onto the skin at the angle of the mouth. It is a narrow bundle of fibers, broadest at its origin, but varies much in its size and form.
NEW: Facial muscle that attaches to the fascia of the masseter muscle and the facia of the skin in the region of the corner (angle) of the mouth. Even in species in which this muscle is present, it is highly variable. A true risorius muscle may only be present in Hominins (humans and great apes). See Diogo 2008; Diogo et al., 2009; Burrows et al.., 2011., also DuBrul, 1980.


UBERON:0008940 : parietal ganglion   
OLD: The lateral ganglia of a snail nervous system are called parietal ganglia. They innerve pallial cavity, gills and skin.
NEW: A lateral ganglion that innervates pallial cavity, gills and skin of a snail[BTO,modified].


UBERON:0008941 : pleural ganglion   
OLD: The pallial cavity's nerve knots are called pleural ganglia. They innerve primarily the mantle or a snail.
NEW: A knot of nerves in The pallial cavity that innervates the mantle of a snail[BTO,modified].


UBERON:0008964 : abdominal ganglion of visceral hump   
OLD: The visceral sacs nerve knot is called visceral ganglion. In contrary to the mostly paired other ganglia this nerve knot is unpaired. The visceral ganglion innerves the pallial organs as well as the inner organs.
NEW: An unpaired knot of nerves in The visceral sacs that innervates the pallial organs as well as the inner organs.


UBERON:0010131 : conducting tissue of heart   
OLD: conducting system of heart plus Purkinje fibers.
NEW: Any portion of cardiac muscle tissue that is part of the conducting system of heart or the Purkinje fibers.


UBERON:0011255 : Eimer's organ   
OLD: sensory organs in which the epidermis is modified to form bulbous papillae. present in many moles, and are particularly common in the star-nosed mole, which bears 30,000 of them on its unique tentacled snout. The organs are formed from a stack of epidermal cells, which is innervated by nerve processes from myelinated fibers in the dermis, which form terminal swellings just below the outer keratinized layer of epidermis. They contain a Merkel cell-neurite complex in the epidermis and a lamellated corpuscle in the dermal connective tissue.

UBERON:0011899 : epimysium   
OLD: Epimysium is a layer of connective tissue which ensheaths the entire muscle. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue. It is continuous with fascia and other connective tissue wrappings of muscle including the endomysium, and perimysium. It is also continuous with tendons where it becomes thicker and collagenous. The Epimysium also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones.
