UBERON:0001599 : stapedius muscle   
OLD: The stapedius is the smallest skeletal muscle in the human body. At just over one millimeter in length, its purpose is to stabilize the smallest bone in the body, the stapes. The stapedius emerges from a pinpoint foramen in the apex of the pyramidal eminence (a hollow, cone-shaped prominence in the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity), and inserts into the neck of the stapes. [WP,unvetted].

UBERON:0001999 : iliopsoas   
OLD: Anatomical cluster consisting of iliacus, psoas major, psoas minor[WP].
NEW: Anatomical cluster consisting of the iliacus and the psoas major[WP].


UBERON:0002500 : zygomatic arch   
OLD: The zygomatic arch or cheek bone is formed by the zygomatic process of temporal bone (a bone extending forward from the side of the skull, over the opening of the ear) and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone (the side of the cheekbone), the two being united by an oblique suture; the tendon of the Temporalis passes medial to the arch to gain insertion into the coronoid process of the mandible. The term zygomatic derives from the Latin zyosislymore meaning malar bone or cheekbone. The zygomatic arch is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term usually refers to the zygomatic bone or occasionally the zygomatic process. The zygomatic process of the temporal arises by two roots: an anterior, directed inward in front of the mandibular fossa, where it expands to form the articular tubercle. a posterior, which runs backward above the external acoustic meatus and is continuous with the supramastoid crest. The upper border of the arch gives attachment to the temporal fascia; the lower border and medial surface give origin to the Masseter. The zygomatic arch is significant in evolutionary biology, as it is part of the structures derived from the ancestral single temporal fenestra of the synapsid ancestor of mammals. [WP,unvetted].

UBERON:0004113 : muscle of auditory ossicle   
OLD: A muscle of head that attaches_to a auditory ossicle.
NEW: A muscle of the tympanic cavity that attaches to an auditory ossicle.


UBERON:0005215 : kidney interstitium   
OLD: The interstitium of the kidney comprises the extravascular intertubular spaces of the renal parenchyma, with their attendant cellular elements and extracellular substances. As we define it here, the interstitium is bounded on all sides by tubular and vascular basement membranes.
NEW: The interstitial compartment of the kidney, comprising the extravascular intertubular spaces of the renal parenchyma, with their attendant cellular elements and extracellular substances, bounded on all sides by epithelial and vascular basement membranes.


UBERON:0005270 : renal cortex interstitium   
OLD: A compartment situated between basement membranes of epithelia and vessels that contains two contiguous cellular networks in mutual contact, one formed by interstitial fibroblasts, the other by dendritic cells.
NEW: A compartment of the renal cortex situated between basement membranes of epithelia and vessels that contains two contiguous cellular networks in mutual contact, one formed by interstitial fibroblasts, the other by dendritic cells.


UBERON:0006216 : cervical sinus of His   
OLD: a temporary depression caudal to the second pharyngeal arch, containing the succeeding pharyngeal arches; it is overgrown by the second pharyngeal arch and closes off as the cervical vesicle[TFD].
NEW: a temporary depression caudal to the second pharyngeal arch, containing the succeeding pharyngeal arches; it is overgrown by the second pharyngeal arch and closes off as the cervical vesicle. This sinus is bounded in front by the hyoid arch, and behind by the thoracic wall.


UBERON:0007365 : rumen   
OLD: The first stomach of ruminants. It lies on the left side of the body, occupying the whole of the left side of the abdomen and even stretching across the median plane of the body to the right side. It is capacious, divided into an upper and a lower sac, each of which has a blind sac at its posterior extremity. The rumen is lined by mucous membrane containing no digestive glands, but mucus-secreting glands are present in large numbers. Coarse, partially chewed food is stored and churned in the rumen until the animal finds circumstances convenient for rumination. When this occurs, little balls of food are regurgitated through the esophagus into the mouth, and are subjected to a second more thorough mastication, swallowed, and passed on into other parts of the compound stomach. (From Black's Veterinary Dictionary, 17th ed).

UBERON:0008593 : zygomaticus major muscle   
OLD: The Zygomatic major is a muscle of the human body. It is a muscle of facial expression which draws the angle of the mouth superiorly and posteriorly. Like all muscles of facial expression, the zygomatic major is innervated by the facial nerve (Cranial Nerve VII). The Zygomaticus extends from each zygomatic arch to the corners of the mouth. It raises the corners of the mouth when a person smiles. Dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of this muscle.
NEW: Facial muscle attached to the modiolus, corner (angle) of the mouth, and zygomatic bone. See Diogo 2008; Diogo et al., 2009; Burrows et al.., 2011., also DuBrul, 1980.


UBERON:0008594 : zygomaticus minor muscle   
OLD: The zygomaticus minor is a muscle of facial expression. It originates from malar bone and continues with orbicularis oculi on the lateral face of the Levator labii superioris and then inserts into the outer part of the upper lip. Do not confuse this with the Zygomaticus major, which insets into the angle of the mouth. It draws the upper lip backward, upward, and outward (used in making sad facial expressions). &lt;/gallery&gt; Like all muscles of facial expression, it is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII).
NEW: Facial muscle attached to the orbicularis oris muscle, anterior root of the zygomatic arch (zygomatic bone or maxilla), and skin in the region of the caudal border of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The muscle is often described as having two heads, one attached to the maxilla and the other attached to the skin overlying the orbicularis oculi. See Diogo 2008; Diogo et al., 2009; Burrows et al.., 2011., also DuBrul, 1980.


UBERON:0008596 : mentalis   
OLD: The Mentalis is a paired central muscle of the lower lip, situated at the tip of the chin. It raises and pushes up the lower lip, causing wrinkling of the chin, as in doubt or displeasure. It is ometimes referred to as the 'pouting muscle. ' Its fibers arise from the incisive fossa of the mandible, then course vertically downward to insert in the skin of the chin. A movement disorder of the mentalis muscle is Geniospasm which is a benign but socially excluding genetic disorder.
NEW: A muscle of facial expression, innervated by the facial nerve, attached to the skin of the lower lip and inferior to the lower lip (in humans this region is called the chin or mental region), the orbicularis oris muscle, and the mandible in the symphyseal region. See Diogo et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2011)
