UBERON:0000057 : urethra   
OLD: A tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. In males, the urethra travels through the penis, and carries semen as well as urine. In females, the urethra is shorter and emerges above the vaginal opening. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination.
NEW: A tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body.


UBERON:0000206 : pharyngeal gill   
OLD: Gills of vertebrates are developed in the walls of the pharynx along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior. In fish, the gills are located on both sides of the pharynx. Gills are made of filaments which help increase surface area for oxygen exchange. In bony fish, the gills are covered by a bony cover called an operculum. When a fish breathes, it opens its mouth at regular times and draws in a mouthful of water. It then draws the sides of its throat together, forcing the water through the gill openings. The water passes over the gills on the outside. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping through the mouth again. The operculum can be very important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills. Lampreys and sharks lack an operculum, they have multiple gill openings. Also, they must use different methods to force water over the gills. In sharks and rays, this ventilation of the gills is achieved either by the use of spiracles or ram ventilation (ventilation by constantly swimming). Although some animals use this method it is much better for animals to use a spiracle because they are less susceptible to injury.
NEW: A gill that develops in the walls of the pharynx along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior. In fish, the gills are located on both sides of the pharynx.


UBERON:0000309 : body wall   
OLD: the external portion of an animal body comprised of ectoderm and mesoderm layers that encloses the body cavity.
NEW: the external portion of an animal body derived from ectoderm and mesoderm layers that encloses the body cavity.


UBERON:0000711 : splenius capitis   
OLD: The splenius capitis is a broad, straplike muscle in the back of the neck. It pulls on the base of the skull from vertebrae in the neck and upper thorax. It arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchæ, from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, and from the spinous processes of the upper three or four thoracic vertebræ. The fibers of the muscle are directed upward and lateralward and are inserted, under cover of the Sternocleidomastoideus, into the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and into the rough surface on the occipital bone just below the lateral third of the superior nuchal line. The Splenius Capitis muscle is innervated by the dorsal rami of spinal nerves C3-C4. The splenius muscle is a prime mover for head extension. The splenius capitis can also allow lateral flexion and rotation of the cervical spine.
NEW: A muscle that arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchæ, from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, and from the spinous processes of the upper three or four thoracic vertebræ and inserts the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and into the rough surface on the occipital bone just below the lateral third of the superior nuchal line[WP,modified].


UBERON:0000948 : heart   
OLD: a myogenic muscular organ found in the cardiovascular system. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. The vertebrate heart is composed of cardiac muscle, which is an involuntary striated muscle tissue found only in this organ, and connective tissue. Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart; however, the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects de-oxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action takes place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery. In the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but, instead, form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the more primitive ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes which presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable[WP].
NEW: A myogenic muscular circulatory organ found in the vertebrate cardiovascular system composed of chambers of cardiac muscle. It is the primary circulatory organ.


UBERON:0000985 : axillary vein   
OLD: In human anatomy, the axillary vein is a large blood vessel that conveys blood from the lateral aspect of the thorax, axilla (armpit) and upper limb toward the heart. There is one axillary vein on each side of the body. Its origin is at the lower margin of the teres major muscle and a continuation of the brachial vein. Its tributaries include the basilic vein and cephalic vein, which are both superficial veins. It terminates at the lateral margin of the first rib, at which it becomes the subclavian vein. It is accompanied along its course by a similarly named artery, the axillary artery. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: Vein that drains the axilla


UBERON:0000989 : penis   
OLD: The penis (plural penises, penes) is an external sexual organ of certain biologically male organisms, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The penis is a reproductive organ, technically an intromittent organ, and for placental mammals, additionally serves as the external organ of urination. The penis is generally found on mammals and reptiles. [WP,unvetted].

UBERON:0001044 : saliva-secreting gland   
(was salivary gland)
OLD: saliva-secreting exocrine glands of the oral cavity[GO]. The salivary glands in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva. They also secrete amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research[WP].
NEW: saliva-secreting exocrine glands of the oral cavity[GO]


UBERON:0001065 : parotid duct   
OLD: The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, is the route that saliva takes from the parotid gland into the mouth. It passes through the buccal fat, buccopharyngeal fascia, and buccinator muscle then opens into the vestibule of the mouth opposite the upper second molar tooth. The buccinator acts as a valve that prevents inflation of the duct during blowing. Running along with the duct superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The duct portion of the parotid gland.


UBERON:0001072 : posterior vena cava   
(was inferior vena cava)

UBERON:0001118 : lobe of thyroid gland   
OLD: The lobes of the thyroid gland are conical in shape, the apex of each being directed upward and lateralward as far as the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thyroid cartilage; the base looks downward, and is on a level with the fifth or sixth tracheal ring. Each lobe is about 5 cm. long; its greatest width is about 3 cm. , and its thickness about 2 cm. The lateral or superficial surface is convex, and covered by the skin, the superficial and deep fasciæ, the Sternocleidomastoideus, the superior belly of the Omohyoideus, the Sternohyoideus and Sternothyreoideus, and beneath the last muscle by the pretracheal layer of the deep fascia, which forms a capsule for the gland. The deep or medial surface is moulded over the underlying structures, viz. , the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, the trachea, the Constrictor pharyngis inferior and posterior part of the Cricothyreoideus, the esophagus (particularly on the left side of the neck), the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, and the recurrent nerves. The anterior border is thin, and inclines obliquely from above downward toward the middle line of the neck, while the posterior border is thick and overlaps the common carotid artery, and, as a rule, the parathyroids. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A lobe of tissue that is part of a thyroid gland.


UBERON:0001187 : testicular artery   
OLD: The testicular artery (the male gonadal artery, also called the internal spermatic arteries in older texts) is a branch of the abdominal aorta that supplies blood to the testis. It is a paired artery, with one for each of the testes. It is the male equivalent of the ovarian artery. Because the testis is found in a different location than that of its female equivalent, it has a different course than the ovarian artery. They are two slender vessels of considerable length, and arise from the front of the aorta a little below the renal arteries. Each passes obliquely downward and lateralward behind the peritoneum, resting on the Psoas major, the right spermatic lying in front of the inferior vena cava and behind the middle colic and ileocolic arteries and the terminal part of the ileum, the left behind the left colic and sigmoid arteries and the iliac colon. Each crosses obliquely over the ureter and the lower part of the external iliac artery to reach the abdominal inguinal ring, through which it passes, and accompanies the other constituents of the spermatic cord along the inguinal canal to the scrotum, where it becomes tortuous, and divides into several branches. Two or three of these accompany the ductus deferens, and supply the epididymis, anastomosing with the artery of the ductus deferens; others pierce the back part of the tunica albuginea, and supply the substance of the testis. The internal spermatic artery supplies one or two small branches to the ureter, and in the inguinal canal gives one or two twigs to the Cremaster. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: One of a pair of arteries that is a branch of the abdominal aorta that supplies blood to a male gonad.


UBERON:0001211 : Peyer's patch

NEW: nodular lymphoid structures on the serosal surface of the intestine.


UBERON:0001333 : male urethra   
OLD: In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek οὐρήθρα - ourethra) is a tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. The urethra has an excretory function in both sexes to pass urine to the outside, and also a reproductive function in the male, as a passage for semen. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A urethra that is part of a male reproductive system.


UBERON:0001334 : female urethra   
OLD: In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek οὐρήθρα - ourethra) is a tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. The urethra has an excretory function in both sexes to pass urine to the outside, and also a reproductive function in the male, as a passage for semen. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A urethra that is part of a female reproductive system.


UBERON:0001392 : flexor hallucis longus   
OLD: The Flexor hallucis longus muscle (FHL) is a muscle of the leg. It is one of the deep muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg. The other deep muscles of the leg are flexor digitorum longus and tibialis posterior. FHL is the largest and most powerful of these deep muscles. The Flexor hallucis longus is situated on the fibular side of the leg. It arises from the inferior two-thirds of the posterior surface of the body of the fibula, with the exception of 2.5 cm. at its lowest part; from the lower part of the interosseous membrane; from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peronæi, laterally, and from the fascia covering the Tibialis posterior, medially. The fibers pass obliquely downward and backward, and end in a tendon which occupies nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muscle. This tendon lies in a groove which crosses the posterior surface of the lower end of the tibia, the posterior surface of the talus, and the under surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus; in the sole of the foot it runs forward between the two heads of the Flexor hallucis brevis, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. The grooves on the talus and calcaneus, which contain the tendon of the muscle, are converted by tendinous fibers into distinct canals, lined by a mucous sheath. As the tendon passes forward in the sole of the foot, it is situated above, and crosses from the lateral to the medial side of the tendon of the Flexor digitorum longus, to which it is connected by a fibrous slip. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A deep muscle of the posterior compartment of the hindlimb that is innervated by the tibial nerve, arises from the fibula and insets in the distal phalanx of pedal digit 1.


UBERON:0001394 : axillary artery   
OLD: In human anatomy, the axillary artery is a large blood vessel that conveys oxygenated blood to the lateral aspect of the thorax, the axilla (armpit) and the upper limb. Its origin is at the lateral margin of the first rib, before which it is called the subclavian artery. After passing the lower margin of teres major it becomes the brachial artery. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: Artery that supplies the axilla


UBERON:0001563 : longus capitis muscle   
OLD: The longus capitis (rectus capitis anticus major), broad and thick above, narrow below, arises by four tendinous slips, from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and ascends, converging toward its fellow of the opposite side, to be inserted into the inferior surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone. It is innervated by a branch of cervical plexus. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A muscle that arises by four tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae and inserts into the inferior surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone.[WP,modified].


UBERON:0001578 : orbicularis oculi muscle   
(was orbicularis oculi)
OLD: A circumorbital muscle in the face that closes the eyelid[HP]. It arises from the nasal part of the frontal bone, from the frontal process of the maxilla in front of the lacrimal groove, and from the anterior surface and borders of a short fibrous band, the medial palpebral ligament. From this origin, the fibers are directed lateralward, forming a broad and thin layer, which occupies the eyelids or palpebræ, surrounds the circumference of the orbit, and spreads over the temple, and downward on the cheek. The palpebral portion of the muscle is thin and pale; it arises from the bifurcation of the medial palpebral ligament, forms a series of concentric curves, and is inserted into the lateral palpebral raphé. The orbital portion is thicker and of a reddish color; its fibers form a complete ellipse without interruption at the lateral palpebral commissure; the upper fibers of this portion blend with the Frontalis and Corrugator. The lacrimal part (Tensor tarsi) is a small, thin muscle, about 6 mm. in breadth and 12 mm. in length, situated behind the medial palpebral ligament and lacrimal sac. It arises from the posterior crest and adjacent part of the orbital surface of the lacrimal bone, and passing behind the lacrimal sac, divides into two slips, upper and lower, which are inserted into the superior and inferior tarsi medial to the puncta lacrimalia; occasionally it is very indistinct. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A circumorbital muscle in the face that closes the eyelid[HP].

NEW: A vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body into the right atrium of the heart.


UBERON:0001587 : subclavian vein   
OLD: In human anatomy, the subclavian veins are two large veins, one on either side of the body. Its diameter is approximately that of the small finger. It is divided into right and left subclavian vein. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The subclavian vein is a paired large vein, one on either side of the body. Their diameter is approximately that of the smallest finger.


UBERON:0001589 : internal thoracic vein   
OLD: In human anatomy, the internal thoracic vein (previously known as the internal mammary vein) is a vessel that drains the chest wall and mamma, a term used for breast in anatomy. Bilaterally, it arises from the superior epigastric vein, accompanies the internal thoracic artery along its course and terminates in the brachiocephalic vein. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A vessel that drains the chest wall and breats and arises from the superior epigastric vein, accompanies the internal thoracic artery along its course and terminates in the brachiocephalic vein..


UBERON:0001641 : transverse sinus   
OLD: The transverse sinuses (left and right lateral sinuses), within a human head, are two areas beneath the brain, which allow blood veins to span the area, from the back of the head towards the nose. They drain from the straight sinus and superior sagittal sinus (along the top and back of the brain) to the sigmoid sinuses (at the center of the head), at the internal jugular vein. See diagram (at right): labeled under the brain as '' . The transverse sinuses are of large size and begin at the internal occipital protuberance; one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the superior sagittal sinus, the other of the straight sinus. Each transverse sinus passes lateralward and forward, describing a slight curve with its convexity upward, to the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and lies, in this part of its course, in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli; it then leaves the tentorium and curves downward and medialward to reach the jugular foramen, where it ends in the internal jugular vein. In its course it rests upon the squama of the occipital, the mastoid angle of the parietal, the mastoid part of the temporal, and, just before its termination, the jugular process of the occipital; the portion which occupies the groove on the mastoid part of the temporal is sometimes termed the sigmoid sinus. The transverse sinuses are frequently of unequal size, with the one formed by the superior sagittal sinus being the larger; they increase in size as they proceed, from back to center. On transverse section, the horizontal portion exhibits a prismatic form, the curved portion has a semicylindrical form. They receive the blood from the superior petrosal sinuses at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and condyloid emissary veins; and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploë. The petrosquamous sinus, when present, runs backward along the junction of the squama and petrous portion of the temporal, and opens into the transverse sinus. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: one of the dural venous sinuses and drains the superior sagittal sinus the occipital sinus and the straight sinus, and empties into the sigmoid sinus which in turn reaches the jugular bulb.


UBERON:0001715 : oculomotor nuclear complex   
OLD: The fibers of the oculomotor nerve arise from a nucleus in the midbrain, which lies in the gray substance of the floor of the cerebral aqueduct and extends in front of the aqueduct for a short distance into the floor of the third ventricle. From this nucleus the fibers pass forward through the tegmentum, the red nucleus, and the medial part of the substantia nigra, forming a series of curves with a lateral convexity, and emerge from the oculomotor sulcus on the medial side of the cerebral peduncle. The nucleus of the oculomotor nerve does not consist of a continuous column of cells, but is broken up into a number of smaller nuclei, which are arranged in two groups, anterior and posterior. Those of the posterior group are six in number, five of which are symmetrical on the two sides of the middle line, while the sixth is centrally placed and is common to the nerves of both sides. The anterior group consists of two nuclei, an antero-medial and an antero-lateral . The nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, considered from a physiological standpoint, can be subdivided into several smaller groups of cells, each group controlling a particular muscle. A nearby nucleus, the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, is responsible for the autonomic functions of the oculomotor nerve, including pupillary constriction and lens accommodation. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: Nuclear complex containing subnuclei that give rise to the axons of the occulomotor nerve, both motor and parasympathetic fibers, situated at the midline at the level of the superior colliculus in the midbrain tegmentum (Brodal, Neurological Anatomy, 3rd ed., 1981, pg 533-534).

NEW: One of the three largest glands of the oral cavity that secrete most of the saliva, including the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands.


UBERON:0001830 : minor salivary gland   
OLD: the smaller, largely mucus-secreting, exocrine glands of the oral cavity, consisting of the labial, buccal, molar, lingual, and palatine glands[MP]. There are over 600 minor salivary glands located throughout the oral cavity within the lamina propria of the oral mucosa. They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the other glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue only surrounded by it. The gland is usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner's glands) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are usually associated with minor salivary glands[WP].
NEW: One of the smaller, largely mucus-secreting, exocrine glands of the oral cavity, consisting of the labial, buccal, molar, lingual, and palatine glands[MP].


UBERON:0001836 : saliva   
OLD: In humans, the saliva is a turbid and slightly viscous fluid, generally of an alkaline reaction, and is secreted by the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands. In the mouth the saliva is mixed with the secretion from the buccal glands. In man and many animals, saliva is an important digestive fluid on account of the presence of the peculiar enzyme, ptyalin[GO].
NEW: A fluid produced in the oral cavity by salivary glands, typically used in predigestion, but also in other functions.


UBERON:0001837 : duct of salivary gland   
OLD: An intralobular duct found in salivary glands and involved in the production and transport of their secretions[BTO].
NEW: The duct of a salivary gland.


UBERON:0001838 : sublingual duct   
OLD: The excretory ducts of the sublingual gland are from eight to twenty in number. Of the smaller sublingual ducts (ducts of Rivinus), some join the submandibular duct; others open separately into the mouth, on the elevated crest of mucous membrane (plica sublingualis), caused by the projection of the gland, on either side of the frenulum linguae. One or more join to form the major sublingual duct (larger sublingual duct, duct of Bartholin), which opens into the submandibular duct. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: A duct of a sublingual gland.


UBERON:0001840 : semicircular canal

NEW: One of three half-circular, interconnected tubes located inside each ear[WP].


UBERON:0002048 : lung   
OLD: Respiration organ present in all air-breathing animals whose principal function is to transport oxygen from the atmosphere into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere[WP]. In all air-breathing vertebrates the lungs are developed from the ventral wall of the oesophagus as a pouch which divides into two sacs. In amphibians and many reptiles the lungs retain very nearly this primitive sac-like character, but in the higher forms the connection with the esophagus becomes elongated into the windpipe and the inner walls of the sacs become more and more divided, until, in the mammals, the air spaces become minutely divided into tubes ending in small air cells, in the walls of which the blood circulates in a fine network of capillaries. In mammals the lungs are more or less divided into lobes, and each lung occupies a separate cavity in the thorax[GO].
NEW: Respiration organ that develops as an oupocketing of the esophagus.


UBERON:0002063 : sinus venosus   
OLD: The sinus venosus is a large quadrangular cavity which precedes the atrium on the venous side of the chordate heart. In humans, it exists distinctly only in the embryonic heart, where it is found between the two venae cavae. In the adult, it is incorporated into the wall of the right atrium to form a smooth part called the sinus venarum, also known as the venarum sinus, which is separated from the rest of the atrium by a ridge of fibres called the crista terminalis. The sinus venosus also forms the SA node and the coronary sinus. In the embryo, the thin walls of the sinus venosus are connected below with the right ventricle, and medially with the left atrium, but are free in the rest of their extent. It receives blood from the vitelline vein, umbilical vein and common cardinal vein. It originally starts as a paired structure but shifts towards associating only with the right atrium as the embryonic heart develops. The left portion shrinks in size and eventually forms the coronary sinus and oblique vein of the left atrium, whereas the right part becomes incorporated into the right atrium to form the sinus venarum.
NEW: The sinus venosus is a large cardiac chamber which precedes the atrium on the venous side of the chordate heart.


UBERON:0002075 : viscus   
OLD: An organ that is located within the body cavity (or in its extension, in the scrotum); it consists of organ parts that are embryologically derived from endoderm, splanchnic mesoderm or intermediate mesoderm; together with other organs, the viscus constitutes the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, reproductive and immune systems, or is the central organ of the cardiovascular system. Examples: heart, lung, esophagus, kidney, ovary, spleen. // An internal organ of the body; especially: one (as the heart, liver, or intestine) located in the great cavity of the trunk proper.
NEW: An organ that is located within the body cavity (or in its extension, in the scrotum); it consists of organ parts that are embryologically derived from endoderm, splanchnic mesoderm or intermediate mesoderm; together with other organs, the viscus constitutes the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, reproductive and immune systems, or is the central organ of the cardiovascular system. Examples: heart, lung, esophagus, kidney, ovary, spleen.


UBERON:0002198 : neurohypophysis   
OLD: comprises the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland and is part of the endocrine system[WP].
NEW: the posterior part of the pituitary gland that secretes hormones involved in blood pressure regulation such as oxytocin and antidiuretic hormon.


UBERON:0002255 : vomeronasal organ   
OLD: The vomeronasal organ (VNO), or Jacobson's organ, is an auxiliary olfactory sense organ that is found in many animals. It was discovered by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813. During embryological development, it forms from the nasal (olfactory) placode, at the anterior edge of the neural plate. It is a chemoreceptor organ which is completely separated from the nasal cavity the majority of the time, being enclosed in a separate bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity. It is a tubular crescent shape and split into two pairs, separated by the nasal septum. It is the first processing stage of the accessory olfactory system, after which chemical stimuli go to the accessory olfactory bulb, then to targets in the amygdala and hypothalamus. The vomeronasal organ is mainly used to detect pheromones, chemical messengers that carry information between individuals of the same species, hence is sometimes referred to as the 'sixth sense. ' The VNO has two separate types of neuronal receptors, V1R and V2R, which are seven-transmembrane receptors that are coupled to G proteins. The receptors are distinct from each other and form the large family of receptors in the main olfactory system. Evidence shows that the VNO responds to nonvolatile cues which stimulate the receptor neurons. Information is then transferred to the accessory olfactory bulb as well as other centres of the brain such as the anterior part of the hypothalamus. Its presence in many animals has been widely studied and the importance of the vomeronasal system to the role of reproduction and social behavior (through influence on anterior hypothalamus) has been shown in many studies. Its presence and functionality in humans is widely controversial, though most studies agree the organ regresses during fetal development. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: An organ thought to supplement the olfactory system in receiving pheromonic communication. The sensory part of the organ is in two long, thin sacs, situated on either side of the nasal septum at its base.


UBERON:0002270 : hyaloid artery   
OLD: The hyaloid artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which is itself a branch of the internal carotid artery. It is contained within the optic stalk of the eye and extends from the optic disc through the vitreous humor to the lens. Usually fully regressed before birth, its purpose is to supply nutrient to the developing lens in the growing fetus. During the tenth week of development in humans (time varies depending on species), the lens grows independent of a blood supply and the hyaloid artery usually regresses. Its proximal portion remains as the central artery of the retina. Regression of the hyaloid artery leaves a clear central zone through the vitreous called the hyaloid canal or Cloquet's canal. Occasionally the artery may not fully regress, resulting in the condition persistent hyaloid artery. More commonly, small remnants of the artery may remain. Free remnants can sometimes be seen as 'floaters'. An anterior remnant of the hyaloid artery can be seen in some people as Mittendorf's dot, a small pinpoint-like scar on the posterior surface of the lens. A posterior remnant may be seen where the artery left the optic disc, and is known as Bergmeister's papilla.
NEW: An artery that is part of the optic stalk of the eye and extends from the optic disc through the vitreous humor to the lens.


UBERON:0002743 : basal forebrain   
OLD: The basal forebrain is a collection of structures located ventrally to the striatum. It is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the CNS. It includes a group of structures that lie near the bottom of the front of the brain, including the nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, and medial septal nuclei. These structures are important in the production of acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. Acetylcholine affects the ability of brain cells to transmit information to one another, and also encourages plasticity, or learning. Thus, damage to the basal forebrain can reduce the amount of acetylcholine in the brain and impair learning. This may be one reason why basal forebrain damage can result in memory impairments such as amnesia and confabulation. One common cause of basal forebrain damage is aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Research, conducted by investigators from Children's Hospital Boston and the University of Helsinki, ties together previous observations about sleep and finds that nitric oxide production in the basal forebrain is both necessary and sufficient to produce sleep. This structure is defined, in part, as the place where adenosine acts on A1 receptors of cholinergic neurons. This results in hyperpolarization of cholinergic neurons, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is known to promote wakefulness in the basal forebrain. Inhibition of acetylcholine release in the basal forebrain by adenosine causes slow wave sleep. The basal forebrain and adjacent areas are a focus for sleep research. Stimulating the basal forebrain gives rise to EEG sychrony and sleep. [WP,unvetted].

UBERON:0003881 : CA1 field of hippocampus   
OLD: A cytoarchitectural subregion of the Ammon's horn region of the hippocampal formation. The principal cell type is the pyramidal neuron. The pyramidal neurons of CA1 receive projections from pyramidal neurons of CA3 via the Schaffer collaterals., A cytoarchitectural subregion of the Ammon's horn region of the hippocampal formation . The principal cell type is the pyramidal neuron. The pyramidal neurons of CA1 receive projections from pyramidal neurons of CA3 via the Schaffer collaterals.
NEW: Part of hippocampus proper bounded by CA2 and the subiculum, characterized by pyramidal neurons that receive projections from pyramidal neurons of CA3 via the Schaffer collaterals.


UBERON:0003883 : CA3 field of hippocampus   
OLD: Region III of hippocampus proper is a portion of the hippocampal formation. Region CA3 receives input along the mossy fibers from granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and from projection cells in entorhinal cortex along the perforant path. The mossy fiber pathway terminates in stratum lucidum while the perforant path passes through stratum lacunosum and terminates in stratum moleculare. The inputs from the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca terminate in stratum radiatum, along with commisural connections from the contralateral hippocampus. The pyramidal cells in CA3 (of which there are approximately 200,000 in each hemisphere in the rat) send some axons back to the hilus, but the majority project to regions CA2 and CA1 (a pathway called the Schaffer collaterals), in addition to a significant number of connections that terminate within CA3 (called recurrent connections). Both the recurrent connections and the Schaffer collaterals terminate preferentially in the septal or dorsal direction from the originating cells. CA3 also sends a small set of output fibers to the lateral septum. The region is conventionally divided into 3 divisions. CA3a is the part of the cell band which is most distal from the dentate (and closest to CA1). CA3b is the middle part of the band nearest to the fimbria/fornix connection. CA3c is the most proximal to the dentate, inserting into the hilus. The region overall has been considered to be the 'pacemaker' of the hippocampus. In CA3 much of the synchronous bursing activity associated with interictal epileptiform activity appears to be generated. The excitatory collateral interconnectivity appears to be the property of CA3 most responsible for this. CA3, unlike other regions, has pyramidal cell axon collaterals ramifying extensively with local region and making excitatory contacts with neighbors. CA3 has been implicated in a number of working theories on memory and learning hippocampal processes. Oscillatory rhythms (10-30Hz) are cholinergically driven patterns that depend on coupling of interneurons and pyramidal cell axons via gap junctions as well as glutaminergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. Sharp EEG waves seen here are also implicated in memory consolidation.
NEW: Part of hippocampus proper bounded by the hilus of the dentate gyrus and area CA2, characterized by large pyramidal cells and a dense projection from dentate gyrus granule cell mossy fibers.

NEW: A transitional population of migrating mesenchymal cells that derive from somites and that will become dermal cells.


UBERON:0004087 : vena cava   
OLD: The superior and inferior vena cava are collectively called the venae cavae. They are the veins that return deoxygenated blood from the body into the heart. They both empty into the right atrium. The inferior vena cava (or posterior vena cava in animals) travels up alongside the abdominal aorta with blood from the lower part of the body (see # 11 in the diagram). It is the largest vein in the body. The superior vena cava (or anterior vena cava in animals) is above the heart, and forms from a convergence of the left and right brachiocephalic veins that contain blood from the head and the arms (see # 3 in the diagram). [WP,unvetted].
NEW: Any of the veins that carries deoxygenated blood from a part of the body into the right atrium of the heart.


UBERON:0004601 : rib 1   
OLD: The first rib is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its borders inward and outward. The head is small, rounded, and possesses only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic vertebra. The neck is narrow and rounded. The tubercle, thick and prominent, is placed on the outer border. There is no angle, but at the tubercle the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward, so that the head of the bone is directed downward. The upper surface of the body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment of the Scalenus anterior; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus. Behind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the Scalenus medius. The under surface is smooth, and destitute of a costal groove. The outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment to the first digitation of the serratus ventralis. The inner border is concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. The anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The first rib of the rib cage


UBERON:0004602 : rib 2   
OLD: The second rib is much longer than the first, but has a very similar curvature. The non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally only feebly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tubercle. The body is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though smaller than that found in the first rib. The body is not flattened horizontally like that of the first rib. Its external surface is convex, and looks upward and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin of the lower part of the first and the whole of the second digitation of the serratus ventralis; behind and above this is attached the Scalenus posterior. The internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward: on its posterior part there is a short costal groove. [WP,unvetted].
NEW: The second rib of the rib cage


UBERON:0004825 : dental lamina   
OLD: a band of epithelial tissue seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins at the sixth week in utero or three weeks after the rupture of the buccopharyngeal membrane. It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Best described as an in-growth of oral ectoderm, the dental lamina is frequently distinguished from the vestibular lamina, which develops concurrently. This dividing tissue is surrounded by and, some would argue, stimulated by ectomysenchymal growth. When it is present, the dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelium of the oral cavity. Eventually, the dental lamina disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is resorbed. In situations when the clusters are not resorbed, (this remanent of the dental lamina is sometimes known as the glands of Serres) eruption cysts are formed over the developing tooth and delay its eruption into the oral cavity. This invagination of ectodermal tissues is the progenitor to the later ameloblasts and enamel while the ectomysenchyme is responsible for the odontogenic papilla and later odontoblasts.
NEW: A band of ectodermal cells growing from the epithelium of the embryonic jaws into the underlying mesenchyme and giving rise to the primordia of the enamel organs of the teeth.

UBERON:0005463 : marginal sinus of lymph node   
OLD: The subcapsular sinus (lymph path, lymph sinus, marginal sinus) is a region within the lymph node immediately deep to the capsule that contains relatively sparse lymphocytes. It thus allows lymph to flow freely through it. The lymph node contains lymphoid tissue, i.e. , a meshwork or fibers called reticulum with white blood cells enmeshed in it. The regions where there are few cells within the meshwork are known lymph sinus. It is lined by reticular cells, fibroblasts and fixed macrophages. Thus, subcapsular (sub=below) sinus lies immediately deep to the capsule of the lymph node and immediately above the cortex. It is continuous with the similar lymph sinuses that flank the trabeculae (the extensions of capsule within the substance of the lymph node). The subcapsular sinus is of clinical importance as it is the most likely location where the earliest manifestations of a metastatic carcinoma in a lymph node would be found.
NEW: bowl-shaped lymph sinuses separating the capsule from the cortical parenchyma, and from which lymph flows into the cortical sinuses.


UBERON:0005481 : tentorial sinus   
OLD: The straight sinus (also known by the alternate anatomical term tentorial sinus), within the human head, is an area beneath the brain, which allows blood veins to span the area, from the center of the head towards the back. It drains from the inferior sagittal sinus (from the center of the brain) to the transverse sinuses (at the back of the head), then to the sigmoid sinuses below the brain.
NEW: An unpaired venous dural sinus that receives blood from the superior cerebellar veins and inferior sagittal sinus and drains into the confluence of sinuses.


UBERON:0005485 : valve of inferior vena cava   
OLD: The valve of the inferior vena cava (eustachian valve) lies at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium. In fetal life, the Eustachian valve helps direct the flow of oxygen-rich blood through the right atrium into the left cardiac atrium via the foramen ovale (preventing blood flowing into the right ventricle). Before birth, oxygen rich blood returning from the placenta mixes with blood from the hepatic veins in the inferior vena cava. Streaming this blood across the atrial septum via the foramen ovale increases the oxygen content of blood in the left atrium. This in turn increases the oxygen concentration of blood in the left ventricle, the aorta, the coronary circulation and the circulation of the developing brain. Following birth and separation from the placenta, the oxygen content in the inferior vena cava falls. With the onset of breathing, the left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. As blood flow to the lungs increases, the amount of blood flow entering the left atrium increases. When the pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, the foramen ovale begins to close and limits the blood flow between the left and right atrium. While the Eustachian valve persists in adult life, it is essentially vestigial. Eustachian Valve (EV), also called valvulae venae cavae inferioris, was described for the first time by the Italian anatomist: Bartolomeo Eustachi (born between 1500 and 1513, died 1574).
NEW: A cardial valve that lies at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium. During embryonic development the Eustachian valve helps direct the flow of oxygen-rich blood through the right atrium into the left cardiac atrium via the foramen ovale (preventing blood flowing into the right ventricle).


UBERON:0005486 : venous dural sinus   
OLD: The dural venous sinuses (also called dural sinuses, cerebral sinuses, or cranial sinuses) are venous channels found between layers of dura mater in the brain.[1] They receive blood from internal and external veins of the brain, receive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space, and ultimately empty into the internal jugular vein.

NEW: Mesenchyme that is part of a developing primary palate.


UBERON:0005871 : palatine process of maxilla   
OLD: The palatine process of the maxilla (palatal process), thick and strong, is horizontal and projects medialward from the nasal surface of the bone. It forms a considerable part of the floor of the nose and the roof of the mouth and is much thicker in front than behind. Its inferior surface is concave, rough and uneven, and forms, with the palatine process of the opposite bone, the anterior three-fourths of the hard palate. It is perforated by numerous foramina for the passage of the nutrient vessels; is channelled at the back part of its lateral border by a groove, sometimes a canal, for the transmission of the descending palatine vessels and the anterior palatine nerve from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and presents little depressions for the lodgement of the palatine glands. When the two maxillae are articulated, a funnel-shaped opening, the incisive foramen, is seen in the middle line, immediately behind the incisor teeth. In this opening the orifices of two lateral canals are visible; they are named the incisive canals or foramina of Stenson; through each of them passes the terminal branch of the descending palatine artery and the nasopalatine nerve. Occasionally two additional canals are present in the middle line; they are termed the foramina of Scarpa, and when present transmit the nasopalatine nerves, the left passing through the anterior, and the right through the posterior canal. On the under surface of the palatine process, a delicate linear suture, well seen in young skulls, may sometimes be noticed extending lateralward and forward on either side from the incisive foramen to the interval between the lateral incisor and the canine tooth. The small part in front of this suture constitutes the premaxilla (os incisivum), which in most vertebrates forms an independent bone; it includes the whole thickness of the alveolus, the corresponding part of the floor of the nose and the anterior nasal spine, and contains the sockets of the incisor teeth. The upper surface of the palatine process is concave from side to side, smooth, and forms the greater part of the floor of the nasal cavity. It presents, close to its medial margin, the upper orifice of the incisive canal. The lateral border of the process is incorporated with the rest of the bone. The medial border is thicker in front than behind, and is raised above into a ridge, the nasal crest, which, with the corresponding ridge of the opposite bone, forms a groove for the reception of the vomer. The front part of this ridge rises to a considerable height, and is named the incisor crest; it is prolonged forward into a sharp process, which forms, together with a similar process of the opposite bone, the anterior nasal spine. The posterior border is serrated for articulation with the horizontal part of the palatine bone.
NEW: A thick, horizontal process of the maxilla. It forms the anterior three quarters of the hard palate, the horizontal plate of the palatine bone making up the rest.


UBERON:0006008 : fibrous ring of heart   
OLD: The right and left fibrous rings of heart (anulus fibrosus cordis) surround the atrioventricular and arterial orifices, and are stronger upon the left than on the right side of the heart. The right fibrous ring is known as the anulus fibrosus dexter cordis, and the left is known as the anulus fibrosus sinister cordis. The atrioventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibers of the atria and ventricles, and for the attachment of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves. The left atrioventricular ring is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring; between these and the right atrioventricular ring is a triangular mass of fibrous tissue, the trigonum fibrosum, which represents the os cordis seen in the heart of some of the larger animals, as the ox and elephant. Lastly, there is the tendinous band, already referred to, the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus. The fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and semilunar valves, they are known as The aortic annulus. Each ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of some of the muscular fibers of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, to which the middle coat of the artery is firmly fixed. The attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring is strengthened by the external coat and serous membrane externally, and by the endocardium internally. From the margins of the semicircular notches the fibrous structure of the ring is continued into the segments of the valves. The middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the vessel is dilated to form the sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary artery.
NEW: A ring of ribrous tissue that surrounds the atrioventricular and arterial orifices


UBERON:0006692 : vertebral canal   
OLD: The spinal canal (or vertebral canal or spinal cavity) is the space in vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes. It is a process of the dorsal human body cavity. This canal is enclosed within the vertebral foramen of the vertebrae. In the intervertebral spaces, the canal is protected by the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly. The outermost layer of the meninges, the dura mater, is closely associated with the arachnoid which in turn is loosely connected to the innermost layer of the meninges, the pia mater. The meninges divide the spinal canal into the epidural space and the subarachnoid space. The pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord. A subdural space is generally only present due to trauma and/or pathological situations. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and contains the vessels that supply the spinal cord, namely the anterior spinal artery and the paired posterior spinal arteries, accompanied by a corresponding spinal veins. The spinal arteries form anastomoses known as the vasocorona of the spinal cord. The epidural space contains loose fatty tissue, and a network of large, thin-walled blood vessels called the anterior vertebral venous plexus and the posterior vertebral venous plexus The spinal canal was first described by Jean Fernel.
NEW: A conduit enclosed within the vertebral foramen of the vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes.


UBERON:0006838 : ventral ramus of spinal nerve   
(was anterior ramus of spinal nerve)
OLD: The ventral ramus (anterior ramus, anterior branch, anterior divisions of the spinal nerves) supply the antero-lateral parts of the trunk, and the limbs; they are for the most part larger than the posterior divisions. In the thoracic region they remain distinct from each other and each innervates a narrow strip of muscle and skin along the sides, chest, ribs, and abdominal wall. These rami are called the intercostal nerves. In regions other than the thoracic, ventral rami converge with each other to form networks of nerves called nerve plexuses. Within each plexus, fibers from the various ventral rami branch and become redistributed so that each nerve exiting the plexus has fibers from several different spinal nerves. One advantage to having plexuses is that damage to a single spinal nerve will not completely paralyze a limb. There are four main plexuses formed by the ventral rami: The cervical plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves C1-C5. Branches of the cervical plexus, which include the phrenic nerve, innervate muscles of the neck, the diaphragm, and the skin of the neck and upper chest. The brachial plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves C5-T1. This plexus innervates the pectoral girdle and upper limb. The lumbar plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves L1-L4. The sacral plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves L4-S4. The lumbar and sacral plexuses innervate the pelvic girdle and lower limbs. The Ventral rami, including the sinuvertebral nerve branches, supply structures anterior to the facet joint, including the vertebral bodies, the discs and their ligaments and joints other spinal nerves to form the lumbo-sacral plexus.
NEW: Branch of spinal nerve that innervates the hypaxial muscles


UBERON:0006839 : dorsal ramus of spinal nerve   
(was posterior ramus of spinal nerve)
OLD: The posterior (or dorsal) branches (or divisions) of the spinal nerves are as a rule smaller than the anterior divisions. They are also referred to as the dorsal rami. They are directed backward, and, with the exceptions of those of the first cervical, the fourth and fifth sacral, and the coccygeal, divide into medial and lateral branches for the supply of the muscles and skin of the posterior part of the trunk. Shortly after a spinal nerve exits the intervertebral foramen, it branches into the dorsal ramus, ventral ramus, and rami communicantes. Each of these latter three structures carries both sensory and motor information. Because each spinal nerve carries both sensory and motor information, spinal nerves are referred to as bmixed nerves. b Dorsal rami carry visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the skin and muscles of the back. Dorsal rami remain distinct from each other, and each innervates a narrow strip of skin and muscle along the back, more or less at the level from which the ramus leaves the spinal nerve. The smaller, posteriorly-directed major terminal branch (with the ventral primary ramus) of all 31 pairs of mixed spinal nerves, formed at the intervertebral foramen and turning abruptly posteriorly to divide into lateral and medial branches, both of which will supply the deep (true) muscles of the back. The medial branch (rami medialis) of the dorsal primary ramus also supplies articular branches to the zygopophyseal joints and the periosteum of the vertebral arch. In the neck and upper back, the medial branch continues through the deep and superficial back muscles to supply overlying skin; in the lower back, the lateral branch does this. Nomina Anatomica lists dorsal primary rami as 'rami dorsales' for each group of spinal nerves: 1) cervical (nervorum cervicalium), 2) thoracic (nervorum thoracicorum), 3) lumbar (nervorum lumbalium), 4) sacral (nervorum sacralium), and 5) coccygeal (nervi coccygei). Synonyms: ramus dorsalis nervorum spinalium, ramus dorsalis, rami posteriores nervorum spinalium, dorsal branch, posterior primary division.
NEW: Branch of spinal nerve that innervates the epaxial muscles


UBERON:0007354 : cartilage of pharyngotympanic tube   
OLD: The cartilage of pharyngotympanic tube, about 24 mm. in length, is formed of a triangular plate of elastic fibrocartilage, the apex of which is attached to the margin of the medial end of the osseous portion of the tube, while its base lies directly under the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx, where it forms an elevation, the torus tubarius or cushion, behind the pharyngeal orifice of the tube. The upper edge of the cartilage is curled upon itself, being bent laterally so as to present on transverse section the appearance of a hook; a groove or furrow is thus produced, which is open below and laterally, and this part of the canal is completed by fibrous membrane. The cartilage lies in a groove between the petrous part of the temporal and the great wing of the sphenoid; this groove ends opposite the middle of the medial pterygoid plate. The cartilaginous and bony portions of the tube are not in the same plane, the former inclining downward a little more than the latter. The diameter of the tube is not uniform throughout, being greatest at the pharyngeal orifice, least at the junction of the bony and cartilaginous portions, and again increased toward the tympanic cavity; the narrowest part of the tube is termed the isthmus. The position and relations of the pharyngeal orifice are described with the nasal part of the pharynx. The mucous membrane of the tube is continuous in front with that of the nasal part of the pharynx, and behind with that of the tympanic cavity; it is covered with ciliated epithelium and is thin in the osseous portion, while in the cartilaginous portion it contains many mucous glands and near the pharyngeal orifice a considerable amount of adenoid tissue, which has been named by Gerlach the tube tonsil. The tube is opened during deglutition by the Salpingopharyngeus and Dilatator tubC&. The latter arises from the hook of the cartilage and from the membranous part of the tube, and blends below with the Tensor veli palatini.
NEW: A triangular plate of elastic fibrocartilage that forms the cartilage component of the pharyngotympanic tube.


UBERON:0007364 : reticulorumen   
OLD: first chamber in the alimentary canal of ruminant animals. It is composed of the rumen and reticulum. The reticulum differs from the rumen with regard to the texture of its lining. The rumen wall is covered in small finger like projections called papillae, which are flattened, approximately 0.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm wide in cattle. The reticulum is lined with ridges that form a hexagonal honeycomb pattern. The ridges are approximately 0.1 - 0.2 mm wide and are raised 0.5 cm above the reticulum wall. The hexagons in the reticulum are approximately 2-5 cm wide in cattle. Despite the differences in the texture of the lining of the two parts of the reticulorumen, it represents one functional space. Microbial fermentation degrades ingested carbohydrates in the reticulorumen to the volatile fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate, and proteins to short peptides, amino acids and ammonia. This fermentation is anaerobic and allows the microbes in the reticulorumen to derive the energy and amino nitrogen in order that they can reproduce. Ruminants absorb the volatile fatty acids across the reticulorumen wall and use them for energy, while the microbes eventually flow out of the rumen into the remainder of the alimentary canal, where they are eventually digested and absorbed. The reticulum, at approximately 5-20 litres, is considerably smaller in capacity than the rumen, which is approximately 100-200 litres in cattle. The oesophageal groove, which links the oesophagus and the omasum is located in the reticulum[WP].
NEW: The first chamber in the alimentary canal of a ruminant stomach, composed of the rumen and reticulum.


UBERON:0008453 : rectus capitis anterior   
OLD: The rectus capitis anterior (rectus capitis anticus minor) is a short, flat muscle, situated immediately behind the upper part of the Longus capitis. It arises from the anterior surface of the lateral mass of the atlas, and from the root of its transverse process, and passing obliquely upward and medialward, is inserted into the inferior surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone immediately in front of the foramen magnum.
NEW: A muscle situated immediately behind the upper part of the Longus capitis that arises from the anterior surface of the lateral mass of the atlas, and from the root of its transverse process that inserts into the inferior surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone immediately in front of the foramen magnum.


UBERON:0008454 : rectus capitis posterior major   
OLD: The Rectus capitis posterior major (Rectus capitis posticus major) arises by a pointed tendon from the spinous process of the axis, and, becoming broader as it ascends, is inserted into the lateral part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone and the surface of the bone immediately below the line. As the muscles of the two sides pass upward and lateralward, they leave between them a triangular space, in which the Recti capitis posteriores minores are seen. Its main actions are to extend and rotate the atlanto-occipital joint.
NEW: A muscle that arises by a pointed tendon from the spinous process of the axis and inserts into the lateral part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone and the surface of the bone immediately below the line.


UBERON:0008455 : rectus capitis posterior minor   
OLD: The Rectus capitis posterior minor (Rectus capitis posticus minor) arises by a narrow pointed tendon from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the atlas, and, widening as it ascends, is inserted into the medial part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone and the surface between it and the foramen magnum, and also takes some attachment to the spinal dura. The synergists are the rectus capitus posterior major and Obliquus capitis. Connective tissue bridges were noted at the atlanto-occipital junction between the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle and the dorsal spinal dura. The perpendicular arrangement of these fibers appears to restrict dural movement toward the spinal cord. The ligamentum nuchae was found to be continuous with the posterior cervical spinal dura and the lateral portion of the occipital bone. Anatomic structures innervated by cervical nerves C1-C3 have the potential to cause headache pain. Included are the joint complexes of the upper 3 cervical segments, the dura mater, and spinal cord. The dura-muscular, dura-ligamentous connections in the upper cervical spine and occipital areas may provide anatomic and physiologic answers to the cause of the cervicogenic headache. This proposal would further explain manipulation's efficacy in the treatment of cervicogenic headache .
NEW: A muscle that arise from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the and is inserted into the medial part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone and the surface between it and the foramen magnum, and also takes some attachment to the spinal dura.


UBERON:0008544 : splenius cervicis   
OLD: The splenius cervicis (splenius colli) arises by a narrow tendinous band from the spinous processes of the third to the sixth thoracic vertebrae; it is inserted, by tendinous fasciculi, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the upper two or three cervical vertebrae.
NEW: A muscle that arises from the spinous processes of the third to the sixth thoracic vertebrae and inserts into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the upper two or three cervical vertebrae[WP,modified].


UBERON:0008549 : prevertebral muscle   
(was prevertebral muscle of neck)
OLD: The prevertebral muscles are the muscles located between the prevertebral fascia (older definition) and the vertebral column, i.e. , the longus capitis and longus colli muscles. It also includes the recti capitis anterior and lateralis.
NEW: One of the muscles deep to the prevertebral fascia on the anterior surface of the cervical and superior three thoracic vertebrae, symmetrically placed on each side of the median plane, including the longus colli, longus capitis, rectus capitis anterior, and rectus capitis lateralis muscles. innervated by anterior rami of cervical spinal nerves.


UBERON:0008612 : muscle of pelvic diaphragm   
OLD: The pelvic floor or pelvic diaphragm is composed of muscle fibers of the levator ani, the coccygeus, and associated connective tissue which span the area underneath the pelvis. The pelvic diaphragm is a muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects. The pelvic floor separates the pelvic cavity above from the perineal region below. The right and left levator ani lie almost horizontally in the floor of the pelvis, separated by a narrow gap that transmits the urethra, vagina, and anal canal. The levator ani is usually considered in three parts: pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus. The pubococcygeus, the main part of the levator, runs backward from the body of the pubis toward the coccyx and may be damaged during parturition. Some fibers are inserted into the prostate, urethra, and vagina. The right and left puborectalis unite behind the anorectal junction to form a muscular sling . Some regard them as a part of the sphincter ani externus. The iliococcygeus, the most posterior part of the levator ani, is often poorly developed. The coccygeus, situated behind the levator ani and frequently tendinous as much as muscular, extends from the ischial spine to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx. The pelvic cavity of the true pelvis has the pelvic floor as its inferior border (and the pelvic brim as its superior border. ) The perineum has the pelvic floor as its superior border. Some sources do not consider 'pelvic floor' and 'pelvic diaphragm' to be identical, with the 'diaphragm' consisting of only the levator ani and coccygeus, while the 'floor' also includes the perineal membrane and deep perineal pouch. However, other sources include the fascia as part of the diaphragm. In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably. Inferiorly, the pelvic floor extends into the anal triangle.
NEW: a muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects. It separates the pelvic cavity above from the perineal region below.


UBERON:0008778 : epaxial musclulature   
OLD: Musculature that is derived from the epaxial myotome region, ventral to the horizontal septum of the vertebrae. Epaxial muscles include other (dorsal) muscles associated with the vertebrae, ribs, and base of the skull. In humans, the erector spinae, the transversospinal muscles (including the multifidus, semispinalis and rotatores), the splenius and suboccipital muscles are the only epaxial muscles.

UBERON:0010946 : occipitofrontalis muscle   
OLD: The occipitofrontalis or epicranius is a muscle which covers parts of the skull. It consists of two parts or bellies: The occipital belly, near the occipital bone, and the frontal belly, near the frontal bone. Some sources consider the occipitofrontalis to be a structure consisting of two distinct muscles, the Frontalis and the occipitalis. However, Terminologia Anatomica currently classifies it as a single muscle.
NEW: The occipitofrontalis or epicranius is a muscle which covers parts of the skull. It consists of two parts or bellies: The occipital belly, near the occipital bone, and the frontal belly, near the frontal bone.


UBERON:0010952 : frontalis muscle belly   
(was frontalis)
OLD: The frontalis muscle is thin, of a quadrilateral form, and intimately adherent to the superficial fascia. It is broader than the Occipitalis and its fibers are longer and paler in color. It is located on the front of the head. It has no bony attachments. Its medial fibers are continuous with those of the Procerus; its immediate fibers blend with the Corrugator and Orbicularis oculi, thus attached to the skin of the eyebrows; and its lateral fibers are also blended with the latter muscle over the zygomatic process of the frontal bone. In the eyebrows, its primary function is to lift them (thus opposing the orbital portion of the orbicularis), especially when looking up. It also acts when a view is too distant or dim. From these attachments the fibers are directed upward, and join the galea aponeurotica below the coronal suture. The medial margins of the Frontales are joined together for some distance above the root of the nose; but between the Occipitales there is a considerable, though variable, interval, occupied by the galea aponeurotica. It could be part of occipitofrontalis muscle.
NEW: A belly of the occipitofrontalis muscle that is near the frontal bone


UBERON:0011022 : flexor hallucis brevis muscle   
OLD: The Flexor hallucis brevis arises, by a pointed tendinous process, from the medial part of the under surface of the cuboid bone, from the contiguous portion of the third cuneiform, and from the prolongation of the tendon of the Tibialis posterior which is attached to that bone. It divides in front into two portions, which are inserted into the medial and lateral sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, a sesamoid bone being present in each tendon at its insertion. The medial portion is blended with the Abductor hallucis previous to its insertion; the lateral portion with the Adductor hallucis; the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus lies in a groove between them; the lateral portion is sometimes described as the first Interosseous plantaris.
NEW: A muscle that originates from the cuboid bone and divides into two portions, which are inserted into the medial and lateral sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, a sesamoid bone being present in each tendon at its insertion.


UBERON:0011111 : humeroradial joint   
OLD: The humeroradial joint, the joint between the head of the radius and the capitulum of the humerus, is a hinge joint. The bony surfaces would of themselves constitute an enarthrosis and allow movement in all directions, were it not for the annular ligament, by which the head of the radius is bound to the radial notch of the ulna, and which prevents any separation of the two bones laterally. It is to the same ligament that the head of the radius owes its security from dislocation, which would otherwise tend to occur, from the shallowness of the cup-like surface on the head of the radius. In fact, but for this ligament, the tendon of the Biceps brachii would be liable to pull the head of the radius out of the joint. The head of the radius is not in complete contact with the capitulum of the humerus in all positions of the joint. The capitulum occupies only the anterior and inferior surfaces of the lower end of the humerus, so that in complete extension a part of the radial head can be plainly felt projecting at the back of the articulation. In full flexion the movement of the radial head is hampered by the compression of the surrounding soft parts, so that the freest rotatory movement of the radius on the humerus (pronation and supination) takes place in semiflexion, in which position the two articular surfaces are in most intimate contact. Flexion and extension of the elbow-joint are limited by the tension of the structures on the front and back of the joint; the limitation of flexion is also aided by the soft structures of the arm and forearm coming into contact.
NEW: A hinge joint between the head of the radius and the capitulum of the humerus.


UBERON:0011203 : urachus mesenchyme   
OLD: Mesenchyme that is part of a urachus.
NEW: Mesenchyme that is part of a developing urachus.


UBERON:0011960 : articular capsule of glenohumeral joint   
OLD: The articular capsule of the humerus is the articular capsule of the shoulder joint. It completely encircles the joint, being attached, above, to the circumference of the glenoid cavity beyond the glenoidal labrum; below, to the anatomical neck of the humerus, approaching nearer to the articular cartilage above than in the rest of its extent. It is thicker above and below than elsewhere, and is so remarkably loose and lax, that it has no action in keeping the bones in contact, but allows them to be separated from each other more than 2.5 cm. , an evident provision for that extreme freedom of movement which is peculiar to this articulation. It is strengthened, above, by the Supraspinatus; below, by the long head of the Triceps brachii; behind, by the tendons of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor; and in front, by the tendon of the Subscapularis.[WP,unvetted]
NEW: An articular capsule that is part of the glenohumeral joint.


UBERON:0011961 : articular capsule of hip joint   
OLD: The articular capsule (capsular ligament) is strong and dense. Above, it is attached to the margin of the acetabulum 5 to 6 mm. beyond the glenoidal labrum behind; but in front, it is attached to the outer margin of the labrum, and, opposite to the notch where the margin of the cavity is deficient, it is connected to the transverse ligament, and by a few fibers to the edge of the obturator foramen. It surrounds the neck of the femur, and is attached, in front, to the intertrochanteric line; above, to the base of the neck; behind, to the neck, about 1.25 cm. above the intertrochanteric crest; below, to the lower part of the neck, close to the lesser trochanter. From its femoral attachment some of the fibers are reflected upward along the neck as longitudinal bands, termed retinacula. The capsule is much thicker at the upper and forepart of the joint, where the greatest amount of resistance is required; behind and below, it is thin and loose. It consists of two sets of fibers, circular and longitudinal. The circular fibers, zona orbicularis, are most abundant at the lower and back part of the capsule, and form a sling or collar around the neck of the femur. Anteriorly they blend with the deep surface of the iliofemoral ligament, and gain an attachment to the anterior inferior iliac spine. The longitudinal fibers are greatest in amount at the upper and front part of the capsule, where they are reinforced by distinct bands, or accessory ligaments, of which the most important is the iliofemoral ligament. The other accessory bands are known as the pubocapsular and the ischiocapsular ligaments. The external surface of the capsule is rough, covered by numerous muscles, and separated in front from the Psoas major and Iliacus by a bursa, which not infrequently communicates by a circular aperture with the cavity of the joint.
NEW: An articular capsule that is part of the hip joint.


UBERON:0013133 : superior phrenic artery   
OLD: The superior phrenic arteries are small and arise from the lower part of the thoracic aorta; they are distributed to the posterior part of the upper surface of the diaphragm, and anastomose with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries.
NEW: A phrenic artery that arises from the lower part of the thoracic aorta and is distributed to the posterior part of the upper surface of the diaphragm, and anastomoses with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries.


UBERON:0013220 : foramen of Panizza   
OLD: The Foramen of Panizza is a hole with that connects the left and right aorta as they leave the heart of all animals of the order Crocodilia. Crocodilians have a completely separated ventricle with deoxygenated blood from the body, or systemic circulation, in the right ventricle and oxygenated blood from the lungs, or pulmonary circulation, in the left ventricle, as in birds and mammals. Two vessels, the left aorta and the pulmonary artery, exit the right ventricle. Blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, as in mammals and birds. However, when a unique active valve leading to the pulmonary artery contracts, pressure in the right ventricle can increase and blood can leave the right ventricle, enter the left aortic arch, and therefore bypass the pulmonary circulation. The foramen of panizza connects the left and right aorta. Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle, sitting in the left aorta, can flow into the right aorta through the foramen of panizza. When the heart is relaxed, some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, sitting in the right aorta, can flow into the left aorta across the foramen of panizza. However, some species of Crocodilians have regulatory sphincters that prevent unwanted flow of blood through the foramen of panizza during non-diving.
NEW: A hole with that connects the left and right aorta in animals of the order Crocodilia.


UBERON:0013233 : supraorbital gland   
OLD: The supraorbital gland is a type of lateral nasal gland found in some species of marine birds, particularly penguins, which removes sodium chloride from the bloodstream. The gland's function is similar to that of the kidneys, though it is much more efficient at removing salt, allowing Penguins to survive without access to fresh water. Contrary to popular belief, the gland does not directly convert saltwater to freshwater. The term supraorbital refers to the area just above the eye socket (which is known as the orbit of the eye. ) Living in saltwater environments would naturally pose a large problem for penguins because the ingestion of saltwater would be detrimental to a penguin's health. Although penguins do not directly drink water, it is taken in when they engulf prey. As a result, saltwater enters their system and must be effectively excreted. The supraorbital gland has thus enabled the penguins' survival in such environments due to its water-filtering capability. The gland is located just above the eyes and surrounds a capillary in the head. This capillary constantly strains out the salt in the saltwater that a penguin takes in. Since the byproduct of the gland has roughly five times as much salt as would normally be found in the animal's fluids, the supraorbital gland is highly efficient. The penguin excretes the salt byproduct as a brine through its bill. Often, the fluid drips out, and this gives the appearance of a runny nose. However, the fluid may also be sneezed out. In the absence of saltwater, caused by captivity, the supraorbital gland will lie dormant as it has no other purpose. Having a dormant supraorbital gland does not negatively affect the health of a penguin.
NEW: A lateral nasal gland that removes sodium chloride from the bloodstream.


UBERON:0013241 : embryonic urethral groove   
OLD: The urethral groove is a temporary linear indentation on the underside (ventral side) of the male penis during embryonic development. In humans, it typically appears around 8 weeks of gestation and becomes closed into a normal male urethra by the 12th week.
NEW: The precursor of the urethra
