UBERON:0000642 : suspensory ligament of duodenum   
OLD: Ligament that connects the duodenum of the small intestines to the diaphragm. It contains a slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum. When it contracts, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents It arises from the right crus as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery and inserts into the third and fourth portions of the duodenum and frequently into the duodenojejunal (DJ) flexure (between the duodenum and the jejunum) as well. 
NEW: A thin muscle connecting the junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery 


UBERON:0002205 : manubrium of sternum   
OLD: broad, upper part of the sternum. Located ventrally with a quadrangular shape, wider superiorly and narrower inferiorly, it articulates with the clavicles and the first two ribs[WP].
NEW: The cranial most segment of the sternum. Located ventrally with a quadrangular shape, wider superiorly and narrower inferiorly, it articulates with the clavicles and the first two ribs[MP,WP].


UBERON:0002390 : hematopoietic system   
OLD: The tissues concerned in production of the blood, including the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus[BTO]. Anatomical system that consists of the blood and blood forming tissues. The bodily system of organs and tissues, primarily the bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes, involved in the production of blood[FD].
NEW: Anatomical system that is involved in the production of hematopoietic cells. In humans this is primarily the bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes.


UBERON:0003054 : roof plate   
OLD: a single row of glia at the dorsal midline of the developing neural tube. This region provides inductive signals for the specification of neuronal cell types and of the specification of neural crest cells. The cells comprising the roof plate are the precursors to radial glial cells.
NEW: a single row of glia at the dorsal midline of the developing neural tube along the entire anterior-posterior axis. This region provides inductive signals for the specification of neuronal cell types and of the specification of neural crest cells. The cells comprising the roof plate are the precursors to radial glial cells.


UBERON:0003079 : floor plate   
OLD: A ventral region of glial cells in the neural tube that provides inductive signals for the specification of neuronal cell types. The floor plate is evident at the ventral midline by the neural fold stage[GO]. A structure integral to the developing nervous system of vertebrate organisms. Located on the ventral midline of the embryonic neural tube, the floor plate is a specialized glial structure that spans the anteroposterior axis from the midbrain to the tail regions. It has been shown that the floor plate is conserved among vertebrates with homologous structures in invertebrates such as the fruit fly Drosophila and the nematode C. elegans. Functionally, the structure serves as an organizer to ventralize tissues in the embryo as well as to guide neuronal positioning and differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube[WP].
NEW: The specialized glial structure (non-neuronal cells) situated at the ventral midline of the embryonic neural tube; this structure spans the anteroposterior axis from the midbrain to the tail regions, separating the left and right basal plates of the developing neural tube, and serves as an organizer to ventralize tissues in the embryo as well as to guide neuronal positioning and differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube.


UBERON:0004547 : decidua capsularis   
OLD: Endometrium that covers the implanted blastocyst.
NEW: The layer of uterine endometrium overlying the implanted chorionic vesicle and facing the uterine cavity


UBERON:0005070 : anterior neuropore   
OLD: The anterior neuropore appears before the process of neural tube closure is complete[GO].
NEW: The neuropore at the anterior (rostral) end of the neural tube.


UBERON:0005071 : posterior neuropore   
OLD: The posterior neuropore appears before the process of neural tube closure is complete[GO].
NEW: The neuropore at the posterior (caudal) end of the neural tube.


UBERON:0005077 : neuropore   
OLD: Joined neural folds at either end of the neural tube.[GO].
NEW: A temporary opening leading from the central canal of the embryonic neural tube to the exterior.


UBERON:0005078 : lamina terminalis of neural tube   
(was lamina terminalis of forebrain vesicle)
OLD: The median portion of the wall of the fore-brain vesicle consists of a thin, the lamina terminalis, which stretches from the interventricular foramen to the recess at the base of the optic stalk and contains the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, which regulates the osmolarity of the blood. This is the rostral end (tip) of the neural tube in the early weeks of development.
NEW: The anterior-most (rostral) portion of the wall of the neural tube, formed by closure of the anterior neuropore; the median strip of the anterior wall of the prosencephalon, which persists in a relatively unchanged state as the cerebral hemispheres grow out forward beyond the original anterior end of the prosencephalon.


UBERON:0005432 : aortic sac   
OLD: the merged ventral aortae of the embryo which supplies blood to the aortic arches[TMD].
NEW: The dilated structure that is lined by endothelial cells and located at the arterial pole of the heart just above (distal to) the truncus arteriosus in mammalian embryos; it is the primordial vascular channel from which the aortic arches (and eventually the dorsal aortae) arise; the aortic sac is homologous to the ventral aorta of gill-bearing vertebrates


UBERON:0006211 : buccopharyngeal membrane   
OLD: The region where the crescentic masses of the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other constitutes a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal membrane (or oropharyngeal membrane), which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx. In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area.
NEW: The thin bilaminar membrane derived from the prechordal plate that is devoid of mesoderm and formed by the apposition of the stomodeal ectoderm with the foregut endoderm; after the embryonic head fold has evolved it lies at the caudal limit of the stomodeum, forming a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx; the membrane eventually disappears, and thus a communication is established between the mouth and the future pharynx.


UBERON:0009210 : pharyngeal membrane   
OLD: a thin fold of ectoderm and endoderm that separates the pharyngeal pouches from the branchial clefts in a developing embryo.
NEW: a thin fold of ectoderm and endoderm that separates the pharyngeal pouches from the pharyngeal clefts in a developing embryo.
