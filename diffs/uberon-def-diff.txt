UBERON:0001953 : presubiculum   
OLD: Area 27 of Brodmann-1909 is a cytoarchitecturally defined cortical area that is a rostral part of the parahippocampal gyrus of the guenon (Brodmann-1909). It is commonly regarded as a synonym of presubiculum (Crosby-62). [WP,unvetted].
NEW: a modified six-layered cortex between the subiculum and the main part of the parahippocampal gyrus.


UBERON:0003902 : retinal neural layer   
OLD: The layer of nerve cells in the retina[XAO]. The part of the retina that contains neurons and photoreceptor cells[GO].
NEW: The part of the retina that contains neurons and photoreceptor cells[GO].


UBERON:0004717 : Brodmann (1909) area 29   
(was Brodmann area 29)
OLD: A cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the retrosplenial region of the cerebral cortex. In the human it is a narrow band located in the isthmus of cingulate gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded internally by the ectosplenial area 26 and externally by the agranular retrolimbic area 30.
NEW: Brodmann area 29, also known as granular retrolimbic area 29 or granular retrosplenial cortex, is a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the retrosplenial region of the cerebral cortex. In the human it is a narrow band located in the isthmus of cingulate gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded internally by the ectosplenial area 26 and externally by the agranular retrolimbic area 30 (Brodmann-1909).


UBERON:0008897 : fin   
OLD: An external membranous process of an aquatic animal as a fish used in propelling or guiding the body[BTO].
NEW: An external projection of an aquatic animal as a fish used in propelling or guiding the body[BTO].


UBERON:0010911 : ossicle   
OLD: Skeletal element that is small dermal or endochondral bone.
NEW: Skeletal element that is often isolated, small, and variable in composition.


UBERON:0012447 : podotheca   
OLD: A horny sheath covering the lowe leg of some birds.
NEW: A horny sheath covering the lower leg of some birds.
