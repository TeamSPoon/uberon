UBERON:0001466 : pedal digit   
OLD: A digit that is part of a pes (foot).
NEW: A digit that is part of a pes (foot)[https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6601-2165].


UBERON:0001489 : manus joint   
OLD: A skeletal joint that is part of a manus [Automatically generated definition].
NEW: A skeletal joint that is part of a manus (hand) [Automatically generated definition].


UBERON:0001707 : nasal cavity   
OLD: a large air filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face[WP].
NEW: An anatomical cavity that is part of the olfactory apparatus. This includes the space bounded anteriorly by the nares and posteriorly by the choanae, when these structures are present.


UBERON:0001728 : nasopharynx   
OLD: uppermost part of the pharynx. It extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate; it differs from the oral and laryngeal parts of the pharynx in that its cavity always remains patent (open)[WP]. In front it communicates through the choanae with the nasal cavities. On its lateral wall is the pharyngeal ostium of the auditory tube, somewhat triangular in shape, and bounded behind by a firm prominence, the torus tubarius or cushion, caused by the medial end of the cartilage of the tube which elevates the mucous membrane.
NEW: uppermost part of the pharynx. It extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate; it differs from the oral and laryngeal parts of the pharynx in that its cavity always remains patent (open)[WP].


UBERON:0003729 : mouth mucosa   
OLD: the mucous membrane epithelium of the mouth. It can be divided into three categories: masticatory, lining, and specialized.
NEW: A mucous membrane that lines the mouth.


UBERON:0004110 : midnasal cavity   
OLD: includes the cavity between the nares and the choanae.
NEW: An anatomical cavity that is the combination of the cavity between the nares and the choanae[HP,modified].


UBERON:0005384 : nasal cavity epithelium   
OLD: An epithelium that is part of a nasal cavity.
NEW: An epithelium that is part of a nasal cavity [Automatically generated definition].


UBERON:0005386 : olfactory mucosa   
OLD: That portion of the nasal mucosa containing the sensory endings for olfaction; the organ of smell[GAID]. The olfactory mucosa is located in the upper region of the nasal cavity and is made up of the olfactory epithelium and the underlying lamina propria, connective tissue containing fibroblasts, blood vessels, Bowman's glands and bundles of fine axons from the olfactory neurons. The mucus protects the olfactory epithelium and allows odors to dissolve so that they can be detected by olfactory receptor neurons. Electron microscopy studies show that Bowman's glands contain cells with large secretory vesicles. The exact composition of the secretions from Bowman's glands is unclear, but there is evidence that Bowman's glands do not produce odorant binding protein[WP].
NEW: That portion of the nasal mucosa containing the sensory endings for olfaction; the organ of smell[MESH].


UBERON:0005725 : olfactory system   
OLD: The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction, or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory system detects volatile, airborne substances, while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence indicates that most often, the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are pheromones. The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the gustatory system as the chemosensory senses because both transduce chemical signals into perception[WP].
NEW: A sensory system that is capable of olfacttion (the sensory perception of smell).


UBERON:0006076 : caudal region of vertebral column   
OLD: Subdivision of vertebral column that corresponds to the sacral subdivision of the body, containing the caudal vertebrae.
NEW: Subdivision of vertebral column that corresponds to the caudal subdivision of the body, containing the caudal vertebrae.
