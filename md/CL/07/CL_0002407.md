 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002407
 * *Label* = mature Vgamma2-positive thymocyte
 * *Definition* = A thymocyte that has a T cell receptor consisting of a gamma chain containing Vgamma2 segment, and a delta chain. This cell type is CD4- negative, CD8-negative and CD24-negative. This cell-type is found in the fetal thymus. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html ]
 * *Comment* = NOTE: currently variable immune gene segments are not represented in the OBO Foundry. Cross-product definitions were not made as a result. Also, there are three different nomenclatures for the variable gamma segments.
