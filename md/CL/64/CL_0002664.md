## Class : cardioblast

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002664
 * *Label* = cardioblast
 * *Definition* = A stem cell that can give rise to multiple cell types (i.e. smooth muscle, endothelial) in the developing heart. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:19745164 ]
 * *Comment* = Discrepancy in develops from origins prevents me from making the assertion that cardioblasts give rise to all instances of cardiocytes as we state cardiac muscle cells develop from cardiac myoblast, which in turn develop from muscle stem cell.
