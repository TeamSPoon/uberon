## Class : preameloblast

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0007000
 * *Label* = preameloblast
 * *Definition* = Skeletogenic cell that has the potential to develop into an ameloblast. Located in the inner enamel epithelium, these cells elongate, their nuclei shift distally (away from the dental papilla), and their cytoplasm becomes filled with organelles needed for synthesis and secretion of enamel proteins. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000034, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMCID:PMC2737325 ]
 * *Comment* = unsure of neural crest contribution. In VSAO we have develops_from CL:0000008
