## Class : naive thymus-derived CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000900
 * *Label* = naive thymus-derived CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell
 * *Definition* = A CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell that has not experienced activation via antigen contact and has the phenotype CD45RA-positive, CCR7-positive and CD127-positive. This cell type is also described as being CD25-negative, CD62L-high and CD44-low. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:add, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000031, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ISBN:0781735149, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:22343568, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html ]
 * *Comment* = This cell traffics in secondary lymphoid organs and blood.  This cell type is compatible with the HIPC Lyoplate markers for 'naive CD8+ T cell', but includes additional markers known to be expressed on naive CD8+ T cells.
