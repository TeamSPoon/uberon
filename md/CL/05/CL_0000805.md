## Class : immature single positive thymocyte

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000805
 * *Label* = immature single positive thymocyte
 * *Definition* = A thymocyte that has the phenotype CD4-negative, CD8-positive, CD44-negative, CD25-negative, and pre-TCR-positive. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:add, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000031, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ISBN:0781735149, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html ]
