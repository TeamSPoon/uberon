## Class : keratocyte

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002363
 * *Label* = keratocyte
 * *Definition* = A keratocyte is a specialized fibroblastÂ residing in the cornea stroma that has a flattened, dendritic cell located between the lamellae with a large flattened nucleus and lengthy processes which communicate with neighboring cells. ThisÂ cornealÂ layer, representing about 85-90% of corneal thickness, is built up from highly regular collagenous lamellae and extracellular matrix components. Keratocytes play the major role in keeping it transparent, healing its wounds, and synthesizing its components. This cell type secretes collagen I, V, VI, and keratin sulfate.
