 * *Label* = type 5 cone bipolar cell (sensu Mus)
 * *Definition* = An ON-bipolar neuron found in the retina and having connections with cone photoreceptors cells and neurons in the inner half of the inner plexiform layer. The axon terminal is restricted to sublamina 3 of the inner plexiform layer. It is narrowly stratified and branched. The dendritic tree has many delicate branches.
