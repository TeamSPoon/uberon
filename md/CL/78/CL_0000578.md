## Class : experimentally modified cell in vitro

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000578
 * *Label* = experimentally modified cell in vitro
 * *Definition* = A cell in vitro that has undergone physical changes as a consequence of a deliberate and specific experimental procedure. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = FB:ma, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ReO:mhb ]
 * *Comment* = This class has been re-labeled to imply reference only to in vitro experimentally modified cells, similarly, the definition has been slightly updated to reflect this. 'experimentally modified cell' refers only to cells in vitro, and not modified in vivo/in environment cells. There is currently no class representing unmodified in vitro cells (other than the parent 'cell in vitro'), or a class representing modified native cells. More granular subclassing of experimentally modified cell can be found in ReO. MHB 1.12.12
