## Class : professional antigen presenting cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000145
 * *Label* = professional antigen presenting cell
 * *Definition* = A cell capable of processing and presenting lipid and protein antigens to T cells in order to initiate an immune response. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:add, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ISBN:0781735149 ]
 * *Comment* = Note change of name; nearly all somatic cells can present antigens to T cells via MHC Class I complexes leading to effector responses, but professional antigen presenting cells constitutively express MHC Class II as well as costimulatory molecules, and thus can initiate immune responses via T cells.
