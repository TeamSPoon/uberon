## Class : short term hematopoietic stem cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002033
 * *Label* = short term hematopoietic stem cell
 * *Definition* = A hematopoietic stem cell capable of rapid replenishment of myeloerythroid progenitors and limited self renewal capability. This cell is Kit-positive, Sca1-positive, CD34-positive, CD150-positive, and is Flt3-negative. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:15572596, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:19022770 ]
 * *Comment* = Markers are associated with mouse cells. These cells are also reportedly CD11b-low and CD90-low.
