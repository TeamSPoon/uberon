## Class : enterocyte of epithelium of large intestine

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002071
 * *Label* = enterocyte of epithelium of large intestine
 * *Definition* = Columnar cell which populate the epithelium of large intestine and absorb water. This cell is the most numerous of the epithelial cell types in the large intestine; bear apical microvilli, contain secretory granules in their apical cytoplasm; secretion appears to be largely mucins, but is also rich in antibodies of the IgA type.
