## Class : skeletogenic cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0007001
 * *Label* = skeletogenic cell
 * *Definition* = Cell that has the potential to form a skeletal cell type (e.g. cells in periosteum, cells in marrow) and produce extracellular matrix (often mineralized) and skeletal tissue (often mineralized). [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000034 ]
 * *Comment* = Needs logical definition. Should be capable_of skeletal system morphogenesis? or skeletal tissue development? needs to be added to GO. NOTES:a cell type of the early embryo (see also: mesenchymal cells) that will give rise to mineralized connective tissue. Scleroblasts can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), chondroblasts (cartilage-forming cells), odontoblasts (dentin-forming cells), ameloblasts (enamel-forming cells). The mesenchymal cells developing into osteoblasts and chondroblasts are derived from the mesoderm. Those developing into odontoblasts are neural crest cells. Those developing into ameloblasts are derived from the ectoderm. (http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=scleroblasts)
