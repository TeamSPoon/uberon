 * *Label* = obsolete mortal cell line cell
 * *Definition* = OBSOLETE: A cell line cell that is expected to be capable of replicating a limited number of times in culture before undergoing senescence. Mortal cell line cells cannot be propagated indefinitely (as immortal cell line cells can). [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ReO:mhb ]
 * *Comment* = Obsoleted in July 2013 and replaced by the CLO 'mortal cell line cell' class, as a result of CLO-OBI-CL alignment efforts.
