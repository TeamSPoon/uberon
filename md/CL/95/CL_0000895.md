## Class : naive thymus-derived CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000895
 * *Label* = naive thymus-derived CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell
 * *Definition* = An antigen inexperienced CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell with the phenotype CCR7-positive, CD127-positive and CD62L-positive. This cell type develops in the thymus. This cell type is also described as being CD25-negative, CD62L-high, and CD44-low. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:add, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000031, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:19100699, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:22343568, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html ]
 * *Comment* = These cells have not been exposed to antigen following thymic T-cell selection; found in blood and secondary lymphoid organs. This cell type is compatible with the HIPC Lyoplate markers for 'naive CD4+ T cell', but includes additional markers known to be expressed on naive CD4+ T cells.
