## Class : type II vestibular sensory cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002069
 * *Label* = type II vestibular sensory cell
 * *Definition* = Mostly cylindrical, resemble Type 1 in their contents and the presence of a kinocilium and stereocilium apically; much greater variation in size, some almost span the entire thickness of the sensory epithelium, while others are smaller than Type 1; receive multiple efferent nerve boutons around their bases as well as afferent endings, which are small expansions rather than chalices.
