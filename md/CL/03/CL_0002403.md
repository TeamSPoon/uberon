 * *Label* = mature Vgamma2-positive fetal thymocyte
 * *Definition* = A thymocyte that has a T cell receptor consisting of a gamma chain containing Vgamma2 segment, and a delta chain. This cell type is CD4- negative, CD8-negative and CD24-negative. This cell-type is found in the fetal thymus. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.immgen.org/index_content.html ]
