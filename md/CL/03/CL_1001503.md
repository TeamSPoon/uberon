## Class : olfactory bulb tufted cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_1001503
 * *Label* = olfactory bulb tufted cell
 * *Definition* = the principal glutaminergic neuron located in the outer third of the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb; a single short primary dendrite traverses the outer external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches, where it receives the input from olfactory receptor neuron axon terminals; axons of the tufted cells transfer information to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = MP:0009955 ]
