## Class : basophil

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000767
 * *Label* = basophil
 * *Definition* = Any of the immature or mature forms of a granular leukocyte that in its mature form has an irregularly shaped, pale-staining nucleus that is partially constricted into two lobes, and with cytoplasm that contains coarse, bluish-black granules of variable size. Basophils contain vasoactive amines such as histamine and serotonin, which are released on appropriate stimulation. A basophil is CD123-positive, CD193-positive, CD203c-positive, and FceRIa-positive.

 * *Comment* = Matures in the bone marrow and account for <1% of leukocytes in the peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow. Basophils are described as being CD11a-positive, CD11b-positive, CD13-positive, CD15-positive, CD18-positive, CD21-positive, CD25-positive, CD29-positive, CD35-positive, CD40-positive, CD40L-positive, CD44-positive, CD45R-negative, CD46-positive, CD49a-positive, CD49b-positive, CD49d-positive, CD55-positive, CD59-positive, CD62L-positive, CD63-positive, CD69-positive, CD90-negative, CD116-positive, CD117-negative, CD124-positive, CD125-positive, CD131-positive, CD161-positive, CD184-positive, CD191-positive, CD192-positive, CD197-positive, CD200R3-positive, CD218-positive, CD282-positive, CD284-positive, CD289-positive, CD290-positive, CD294-positive, natural killer cell receptor 2B4-positive, smad1-positive, CD3-negative, CD4-negative, CD7-negative, CD8-negative, CD14-negative, CD15-negative, CD16-negative, CD19-negative, CD20-negative, CD34-negative, CD36-negative, CD45R-negative, CD56-negative, CD57-negative, CD235a-negative, and GR1-negative.
