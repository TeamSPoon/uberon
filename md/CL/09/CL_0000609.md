## Class : vestibular hair cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000609
 * *Label* = vestibular hair cell
 * *Definition* = A mechanoreceptor located in the acoustic maculae and the semicircular canals that mediates the sense of balance, movement, and head position. The vestibular hair cells are connected to accessory structures in such a way that movements of the head displace their stereocilia. This influences the membrane potential of the cells which relay information about movements via the vestibular part of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem.
