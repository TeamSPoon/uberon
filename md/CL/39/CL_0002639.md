## Class : amniotic stem cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002639
 * *Label* = amniotic stem cell
 * *Definition* = An amniotic stem cell is a mesenchymalstem cell extracted from amniotic fluid. Amniotic stem cells are able to differentiate into various tissue type such as skin, cartilage, cardiac tissue, nerves, muscle, and bone [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:20942606 ]
 * *Comment* = Not clear to me if amniotic stem cell is a different cell type from amnion mesenchymal stem cells. They are treated as distinct in the literature as isolations methods are different, so I will keep them as separate terms for now.
