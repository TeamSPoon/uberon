 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000116
 * *Label* = pioneer neuron
 * *Definition* = Pioneer neurons establish a pathway in the developing central nervous system and then undergo programmed cell death once the adult axons, which follow them, have made connections with the target site. Thus, they are a transient cell type involved in axon guidance.
