## Class : radial glial cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000681
 * *Label* = radial glial cell
 * *Definition* = A cell present in the developing CNS. Functions as both a precursor cell and as a scaffold to support neuronal migration. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:dph ]
 * *Comment* = Unlike that of mammals, the brain of adult teleost fish exhibits an intense and widespread neurogenic activity as a result of the persistence of
radial glial cells acting as neural progenitors throughout life.
