## Class : type IIa muscle cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002214
 * *Label* = type IIa muscle cell
 * *Definition* = A type II muscle cell that contains large amounts of myoglobin, has many mitochondria and very many blood capillaries. Type II A cells are red, have a very high capacity for generating ATP by oxidative metabolic processes, split ATP at a very rapid rate, have a fast contraction velocity and are resistant to fatigue. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:tfm ]
