## Class : type 2 cone bipolar cell (sensu Mus)

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000754
 * *Label* = type 2 cone bipolar cell (sensu Mus)
 * *Definition* = An OFF-bipolar neuron found in the retina and having connections with cone photoreceptors cells and neurons in the outer half of the inner plexiform layer. The dendritic tree is not well filled and the dendrites are more delicate than in type 1 cells. The axon terminal is bushier and exhibits a dense plexus of varicosities in the inner part of sublamina 1. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:14689473 ]
