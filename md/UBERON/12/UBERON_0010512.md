 * *Label* = strand of guard hair
 * *Definition* = A long, straight truncal hair that contains two air cells in the medulla[MP]. A strand of hair from the top layer consisting of longer, often coarser, straight shafts of hair that stick out through the underfur. This is usually the visible layer for most mammals and contains most of the pigmentation. It protects the underfur from outside factors, such as rain, and is thus often water-repellent.
