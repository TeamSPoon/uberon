## Class : ulnar nerve

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001494
 * *Label* = ulnar nerve
 * *Definition* = In human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve which runs near the ulna bone. The ulnar nerve is the largest unprotected nerve in the human body (meaning, unprotected by muscle or bone), and the only unprotected nerve that does not serve a purely sensory function (those nerves specifically meant to perceive changes in the environment, such as nerves in the skin). This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, supplying the palmar side of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds. One method of injuring the nerve is to strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed. The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point. This is commonly referred to as hitting one's 'funny bone. ' This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the words 'humerus' and 'humourous' . [WP,unvetted].
