## Class : fasciculus aberans

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0013614
 * *Label* = fasciculus aberans
 * *Definition* = The fasciulus aberrans is a distinct bundle of fibers at the dorsal aspect of the anterior commisure. These fibers travel in the internal capsule between the putamen and caudate nuclei, and cross the midline to connect the dorsal neocortex of the two hemispheres. When the fasciculus aberrans is absent, the fibers connecting the neocortex of the two hemispheres takes a diffderent route through the external capsule[Johnson et al., (1982a, 1982b, 1994)] [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = MorphoBank:177 ]
