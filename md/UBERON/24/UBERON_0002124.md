## Class : medulla of thymus

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002124
 * *Label* = medulla of thymus
 * *Definition* = Medullary portion of thymus. The reticulum is coarser than in the cortex, the lymphoid cells are relatively fewer in number, and there are found peculiar nest-like bodies, the concentric corpuscles of Hassall. These concentric corpuscles are composed of a central mass, consisting of one or more granular cells, and of a capsule formed of epithelioid cells. They are the remains of the epithelial tubes, which grow out from the third branchial pouches of the embryo to form the thymus. Each follicle is surrounded by a vascular plexus, from which vessels pass into the interior, and radiate from the periphery toward the center, forming a second zone just within the margin of the medullary portion. In the center of the medullary portion there are very few vessels, and they are of minute size. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Thymus#Medulla ]
