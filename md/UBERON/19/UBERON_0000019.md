## Class : camera-type eye

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000019
 * *Label* = camera-type eye
 * *Definition* = The camera-type eye is an organ of sight that receives light through an aperture and focuses it through a lens, projecting it on a photoreceptor field[GO]. The eye contains the following parts (when they are present in the organism): the eyeball (eye proper), the lacrimal apparatus, the conjuctival, the eyelid.

 * *Comment* = AO notes: FMA distinguishes Eye (subdivision of face) which has its parts an Eyeball (organ). MA includes eyelid, conjunctiva and lacrimal apparatus as part of MA:eye - consistent with FMA - so we can infer that MA:eye is more like FMA:eye than FMA:eyeball. For other AOs this distinction is less meaningful - e.g. ZFA has no eyelid; XAO has no eyelid, but it has conjuctiva, which is considered part of the xao:eye. GO considers eyelid development part of eye development. See also notes on optic nerve - XAO, AAO and BTO consider this part of the eye. MA considers the eye muscles part of the eye, whereas FMA has a class 'orbital content' for this

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The eye of the adult lamprey is remarkably similar to our own, and it possesses numerous features (including the expression of opsin genes) that are very similar to those of the eyes of jawed vertebrates. The lamprey's camera-like eye has a lens, an iris and extra-ocular muscles (five of them, unlike the eyes of jawed vertebrates, which have six), although it lacks intra-ocular muscles. Its retina also has a structure very similar to that of the retinas of other vertebrates, with three nuclear layers comprised of the cell bodies of photoreceptors and bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells. The southern hemisphere lamprey, Geotria australis, possesses five morphological classes of retinal photoreceptor and five classes of opsin, each of which is closely related to the opsins of jawed vertebrates. Given these similarities, we reach the inescapable conclusion that the last common ancestor of jawless and jawed vertebrates already possessed an eye that was comparable to that of extant lampreys and gnathostomes. Accordingly, a vertebrate camera-like eye must have been present by the time that lampreys and gnathostomes diverged, around 500 Mya.[well established][VHOG]
