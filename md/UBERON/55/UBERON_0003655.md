 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003655
 * *Label* = molar tooth
 * *Definition* = Molars are the rearmost and most complicated kind of tooth in most mammals. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + Wikipedia:Molar_(tooth)]
 * *Comment* = Adult humans have twelve molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. It is the last tooth to appear, breaking through the surface of the gum at about the age of twenty, although this varies from individual to individual. Ethnicity can also have an impact on the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. The human mouth contains upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) molars. They are: maxillary first molar, maxillary second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and mandibular third molar.
