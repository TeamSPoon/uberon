## Class : Eimer's organ

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011255
 * *Label* = Eimer's organ
 * *Definition* = sensory organs in which the epidermis is modified to form bulbous papillae. present in many moles, and are particularly common in the star-nosed mole, which bears 30,000 of them on its unique tentacled snout. The organs are formed from a stack of epidermal cells, which is innervated by nerve processes from myelinated fibers in the dermis, which form terminal swellings just below the outer keratinized layer of epidermis. They contain a Merkel cell-neurite complex in the epidermis and a lamellated corpuscle in the dermal connective tissue.
