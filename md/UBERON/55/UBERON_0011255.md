## Class : Eimer's organ

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011255
 * *Label* = Eimer's organ
 * *Definition* = A sensory organ in which the epidermis is modified to form bulbous papillae. The organs are formed from a stack of epidermal cells, which is innervated by nerve processes from myelinated fibers in the dermis, which form terminal swellings just below the outer keratinized layer of epidermis. They contain a Merkel cell-neurite complex in the epidermis and a lamellated corpuscle in the dermal connective tissue.
