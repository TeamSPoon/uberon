 * *[definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md)* = Mesenchyme that develops_from a neural crest and is part of a 3rd arch mesenchyme.
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = In all vertebrates, the pharyngeal apparatus develops from a series of bulges found on the lateral surface of the head, the pharyngeal arches, which consist of a number of different embryonic cell types. Each arch has an external covering of ectoderm and inner covering of endoderm, and between these a mesenchymal filling of neural crest with a central core of mesoderm.[well established][VHOG]
