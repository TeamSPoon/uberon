## Class : hyoid apparatus

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010272
 * *Label* = hyoid apparatus
 * *Definition* = A group of bones comprised of hyoid body and two pairs of cornua (i.e. greater cornua and lesser cornua), and lies just below the tongue, above the thyroid cartilage [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Hyoid_apparatus ]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: In most mammals, including humans, the hyoid apparatus is shaped like a horseshoe. However, in humans, some of the bones of the hyoid apparatus are fused into a single bone called os hyoideum. In other animals such as frogs, the hyoid apparatus has a hyoid body that is chiefly comprised of hyaline cartilage and two pairs of processes (i.e. alary process and the posteriolateral process).
