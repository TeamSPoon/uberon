## Class : regular connective tissue

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0007845
 * *Label* = regular connective tissue
 * *Definition* = Connective tissue, which consists of fibroblasts, the intercellular matrix of which contains a regular network of collagen and elastic fiber bundles. Examples: bone (tissue), cartilage (tissue), dense regular connective tissue. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = FMA:20103 ]
 * *Comment* = Editor notes: the connective tissue hierarchy largely follows FMA with definitions from VSAO. Note that in FMA, loose-CT is irregular-CT. This means regular-CT is necessarily equivalent to dense-regular-CT (assuming a JEPD classification).
