 * *[definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md)* = Connective tissue, which consists of fibroblasts, the intercellular matrix of which contains a regular network of collagen and elastic fiber bundles. Examples: bone (tissue), cartilage (tissue), dense regular connective tissue.
 * *[editor note](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md)* = the connective tissue hierarchy largely follows FMA with definitions from VSAO. Note that in FMA, loose-CT is irregular-CT. This means regular-CT is necessarily equivalent to dense-regular-CT (assuming a JEPD classification).
