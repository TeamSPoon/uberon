## Class : hyoid muscle

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005493
 * *Label* = hyoid muscle
 * *Definition* = One of a group of muscles used in mastication and swallowing. These muscles are attached to the hyoid bone, which is suspended in the neck and forms the base of the tongue and larynx. In humans, the muscles are divided into suprahyoid (superior) or infrahyoid (inferior) groups relative to the bone[WP, generalized].

 * *Comment* = Editor notes: PMID:19531159 states that facial muscles are hyoid muscles

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = Although the zebrafish occupies a rather derived phylogenetic position within actinopterygians and even within teleosts, with respect to the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles it seems justified to consider it an appropriate representative of these two groups. Among these muscles, the three with clear homologues in tetrapods and the further three identified in sarcopterygian fish are particularly appropriate for comparisons of results between the actinopterygian zebrafish and the sarcopterygians.[well established][VHOG]
