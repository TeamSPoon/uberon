## Class : mammillary axonal complex

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006695
 * *Label* = mammillary axonal complex
 * *Definition* = The mammillary axonal complex is formed by the axons from the lateral, medial mammillary and the dorsal premammillary nuclei which share a branching pattern. Every neuron gives off one axonal stem that bifurcates into 2 branches. One of the branches is directed dorsally to the thalamus and another caudally to the midbrain[GO].
