 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0014895
 * *Label* = somatic muscle
 * *Definition* = A muscle structure of invertebrates whose origin and insertion sites are in basal side of the epidermis or structures derived from it. The simplest somatic muscles consist of a single cell and associated extracellular structures. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GOC:DOS ]
