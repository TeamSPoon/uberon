## Class : nematode larval stage

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004729
 * *Label* = nematode larval stage
 * *Definition* = Nematode larval development begins with the newly hatched first-stage larva (L1) and ends with the end of the last larval stage (for example the fourth larval stage (L4) in C. elegans). Each stage of nematode larval development is characterized by proliferation of specific cell lineages and an increase in body size without alteration of the basic body plan. Nematode larval stages are separated by molts in which each stage-specific exoskeleton, or cuticle, is shed and replaced anew. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO:0002119 ]
