 * *Label* = flat bone
 * *Definition* = Flat bones are those bones which are found where the principal requirement is either extensive protection or the provision of broad surfaces for muscular attachment, the bones are expanded into broad, flat plates, as in the cranium, the ilium, sternum, rib cage, the sacrum and the scapula. These bones are composed of two thin layers of compact tissue enclosing between them a variable quantity of cancellous tissue, which is the location of red bone marrow. In an adult, most red blood cells are formed in flat bones. In the cranial bones, the layers of compact tissue are familiarly known as the tables of the skull; the outer one is thick and tough; the inner is thin, dense, and brittle, and hence is termed the vitreous table. The intervening cancellous tissue is called the diploC+, and this, in certain regions of the skull, becomes absorbed so as to leave spaces filled with air (air-sinuses) between the two tables. The flat bones are: the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lacrimal, vomer, scapula, os coxC&, sternum, and ribs.
