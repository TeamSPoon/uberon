 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Extreme capsule is an organ subdivision of the telencephalon which is made up primarily of myelinated axonal neural tissue (white matter). The extreme capsule is a sheet-like fiber bundle located lateral to the clausturm and medial to the insula which projects dorsally to the white matter underlying the cerebral cortex[FMA:61960].
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The extreme capsule is a long association fiber pathway of white matter in the brain that provides bidirectional communication between such areas as the claustrum and the insular cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle-posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus. Its fibers are near to but can be distinguished by MRI tractography from adjacent fiber bundles such as the uncinate fasciculus, the external capsule, the arcuate fascicle, and the medial, inferior and superior longitudinal fascicles. Given its bidirectional connection between the Broca's and Werniche's speech areas it could have a role in language[Wikipedia:Extreme_capsule, Wikipedia:Extreme_capsule].
