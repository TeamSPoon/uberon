## Class : floor plate

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003079
 * *Label* = floor plate
 * *Definition* = A ventral region of glial cells in the neural tube that provides inductive signals for the specification of neuronal cell types. The floor plate is evident at the ventral midline by the neural fold stage[GO]. A structure integral to the developing nervous system of vertebrate organisms. Located on the ventral midline of the embryonic neural tube, the floor plate is a specialized glial structure that spans the anteroposterior axis from the midbrain to the tail regions. It has been shown that the floor plate is conserved among vertebrates with homologous structures in invertebrates such as the fruit fly Drosophila and the nematode C. elegans. Functionally, the structure serves as an organizer to ventralize tissues in the embryo as well as to guide neuronal positioning and differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube[WP].

 * *Comment* = Note that although this is classically defined as being located on the neural tube, in many AOs the floor plate continues post-embryonically after the neural tube has ceased to exist. Consider 'floor plate of neural tube'.
