## Class : bone marrow cavity

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002484
 * *Label* = bone marrow cavity
 * *Definition* = the central cavity of bone shafts where red bone marrow and/or yellow bone marrow (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity. Located in the main shaft (cortical bone) of a long bone (diaphysis) (consisting mostly of compact bone), the medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined with a thin, vascular membrane (endosteum) [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Bone_marrow_of_ovaryry_cavity ]
 * *Comment* = AO notes: not clear if the FMA intends to have two classes. MP:0000065: "the medullary cavities of the bones.". NCITA also has "medullary bone"
