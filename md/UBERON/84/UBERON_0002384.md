## Other Annotations

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = One of the four types of tissue in traditional classifications. It is largely a category of exclusion rather than one with a precise definition, but there are certain characteristics shared by all or most tissues in this category, such as involvement in structure and support, derived from mesoderm, and characterized largely by the traits of non-living tissue.[AAO]
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Portion of tissue that consists of mesodermally derived cells and intercellular matrix comprised of protein fibers and carbohydrates, which supports, ensheathes and binds together other tissues.[TAO]
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Tissue with cells that deposit non-polarized extracellular matrix including connective tissue fibers and ground substance.[VSAO]
