## Class : obsolete palatine

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002158
 * *Label* = obsolete palatine
 * *Definition* = Compound endochdondral and dermal bone that results from the fusion of the dermal dermopalatine and the endochondral autopalatine and forms the antero-lateral region of the palate. Commonly, it articulates with the maxilla antero-laterally and with the ethmoidal region medially. The palatine is paired. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = TAO:GA_TG ]
 * *Comment* = Depending on the teleostean group, the palatine may articulate with the entopterygoid posteriorly. The term palatine is usually used for the more advanced teleosts with a large autopalatine and a small dermopalatine represented by a few teeth.
