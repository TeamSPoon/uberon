 * *Label* = epithelial scleral papilla layer
 * *Comment* = Development notes: The scleral ossicles are of dermal (neural crest) origin, develop intramembranously within the scleral mesenchyme, and are induced to form by overlying (transient) epithelial scleral papillae (Nelson, 1942; Murray, 1943; Fyfe and Hall, 1981, 1983; Hall, 1981, 2005; Pinto and Hall, 1991). Taxon notes: Scleral papillae (which induce scleral ossicles in birds) have not been reported in teleosts, but evidence for their presence may not have been sought
