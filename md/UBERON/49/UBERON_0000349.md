## Class : limbic system

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000349
 * *Label* = limbic system
 * *Definition* = A set of midline structures surrounding the brainstem of the mammalian brain, originally described anatomically, e.g., hippocampal formation, amygdala, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex. Although the original designation was anatomical, the limbic system has come to be associated with the system in the brain subserving emotional functions. As such, it is very poorly defined and doesn't correspond closely to the anatomical meaning any longer. [BirnLex]. including the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, and limbic cortex, which support a variety of functions including emotion, behavior, long term memory, and olfaction [Wikipedia].

 * *Comment* = obsoletion recommended. The current part_of children were chosen as the intersection of what is stated in wikipedia and in the FMA. NIF: We are including Limbic System because it is still used by neuroscientists and others, but as a data annotation term, it is very poor because it is not a clearly defined entity.
