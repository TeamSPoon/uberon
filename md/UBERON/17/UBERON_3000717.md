## Class : amphicoelous

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000717
 * *Label* = amphicoelous
 * *Definition* = Ectochordal, biconcave or terminally flat vertebral centrum. This design seems to allow limited motion in most directions. An intervertebral body (which may or may not be independent from the adjacent centra) fills the cavity between successive centra. The intervertebral body usually is formed by soft material that may be derived, at least in part, from the embryonic notochord.
