## Class : obsolete peripheral nerve

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002003
 * *Label* = obsolete peripheral nerve
 * *Definition* = A cable-like bundle of peripheral axons (the long, slender projections of neurons). A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons. Nerves are found only in the peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts[WP]. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve ]
