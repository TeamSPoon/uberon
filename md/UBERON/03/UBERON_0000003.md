## Class : naris

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000003
 * *Label* = naris
 * *Definition* = Orifice of the olfactory system. The naris is the route by which odorants enter the olfactory system[MAH]. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = UBERON:MAH ]
 * *Comment* = consistency notes: we have classified this as an orifice, according to FMA. Note that in FMA, orifices are immaterial entities, but in ZFA this is a surface structure. Taxon notes: in actinopterygians, both pairs of nares are external. In tetrapods, the exhalant empties into the buccal cavity

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = One of paired external openings of the nasal chamber.[AAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = Naris refer to the external and interior naris (choana) of tetrapods, and to anterior and posterior naris of zebrafish. It seems now accepted that the structure is homologous: The choana, a unique 'internal nostril' opening from the nasal sac into the roof of the mouth, is a key part of the tetrapod (land vertebrate) respiratory system. It was the first component of the tetrapod body plan to evolve, well before the origin of limbs, and is therefore crucial to our understanding of the beginning of the fish-tetrapod transition.  (...) Here we present new material of Kenichthys, a 395-million-year-old fossil fish from China, that provides direct evidence for the origin of the choana and establishes its homology: it is indeed a displaced posterior external nostril that, during a brief transitional stage illustrated by Kenichthys, separated the maxilla from the premaxilla.[well established][VHOG]
