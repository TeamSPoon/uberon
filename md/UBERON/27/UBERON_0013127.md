 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Pulmonary circulation is the half portion of the cardiovascular system which carries oxygen-depleted blood away from the heart, to the lungs, and returns oxygenated (oxygen-rich) blood back to the heart. The term pulmonary circulation is readily paired and contrasted with the systemic circulation. A separate system known as the bronchial circulation supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.
