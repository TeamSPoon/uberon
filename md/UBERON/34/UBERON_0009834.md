 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0009834
 * *Label* = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
 * *Definition* = The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC or DLPFC), according to a more restricted definition, is roughly equivalent to Brodmann areas 9 and 46.[1] According to a broader definition DL-PFC consists of the lateral portions of Brodmann areas 9 Ð 12, of areas 45, 46, and the superior part of area 47.[2] These regions mainly receive their blood supply from the middle cerebral artery. With respect to neurotransmitter systems, there is evidence that dopamine plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC.[2]DL-PFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex ]
 * *Comment* = check dorsolateral prefrontal neocortex
