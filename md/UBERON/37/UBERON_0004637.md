## Class : otic capsule

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004637
 * *Label* = otic capsule
 * *Definition* = The capsule surrounding the inner ear mechanism; in elasmobranchs, it remains cartilaginous in the adult; in the embryos of higher vertebrates, it is cartilaginous at first but later becomes bony (at approximately 23 weeks in humans)[Biology-Online]. Bilaterally paired cartilage encasing the semicircular canals of the inner ear[ZFA].

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = Otic capsules develop around the parts of the ear that lie within the chondrocranium. This part of the ear, known as the inner ear, is composed of the semicircular ducts and associated sacs that contain the receptive cells for equilibrium and hearing (reference 1); (...) considerations have led to our rethinking issues related to the origin of several aspects of vertebrate hearing, and to the view that many basic auditory functions evolved very early in vertebrate history, and that the functions observed in more `advanced' vertebrates, such as birds and mammals, are frequently modifications of themes first encountered in fishes, and perhaps even more ancestral animals.[well established][VHOG]
