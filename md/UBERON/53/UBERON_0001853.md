## Class : utricle of membranous labyrinth

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001853
 * *Label* = utricle of membranous labyrinth
 * *Definition* = one of the two otolith organs located in the vertebrate inner ear. These use small stones and a viscous fluid to stimulate hair cells to detect motion and orientation. The utricle is larger than the saccule and is of an oblong form, compressed transversely, and occupies the upper and back part of the vestibule, lying in contact with the recessus ellipticus and the part below it. The utricle contains mechanoreceptors called hair cells that distinguish between degrees of tilting of the head, thanks to their apical cilia set-up. These are covered by otolith which, due to gravity, pull on the cilia and tilt them. Depending on whether the tilt is in the direction of the kinocilium or not, the resulting hair cell polarisation is excitatory (depolarising) or inhibitory (hyperpolarisation), respectively. This signal to the vestibular nerve (which takes it to the brainstem) does not adapt with time. The effect of this is that, for example, an individual lying down to sleep will continue to detect that they are lying down hours later when they awaken[WP].

 * *Comment* = XAO/AAO to be checked - see https://github.com/seger/aao/issues/5; AAO has both utricle and utriculus; these are generally considered synonyms - e.g. http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=utriculus
