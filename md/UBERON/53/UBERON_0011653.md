## Class : diapophysis of neural arch

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011653
 * *Label* = diapophysis of neural arch
 * *Definition* = Paired processes that arise near the midpoint of the neural arch lamina, for the attachment of the tuberculum of two-headed ribs. Also called transverse processes. In anurans, the term diapophysis is used in reference to the modified transverse processes of the sacral vertebra elaborated for support of the pelvic girdle. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = AAO:0000706 ]
