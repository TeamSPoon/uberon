## Class : cementum

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001753
 * *Label* = cementum
 * *Definition* = Odontoid tissue that is deposited by cementoblasts onto dentine tissue and functions to attach teeth, odontodes and other odontogenic derivatives to bone tissue and the integument.

 * *Comment* = Cementum, the supporting tissue that anchors mammalian and crocodylian teeth into their sockets, differs among species and can have features of dentine, of bone, and of calcified cartilage, as well as unique features. Cementum is deposited by cementoblasts onto existing dentine. As in bone and dentine, cementoblasts produce an organic matrix, the main constituent of which is collagen type I (Bosshardt, 2005), but cementum, dentine, and bone also share a number of important noncollagenous matrix components such as osteopontin, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, a2-HS- glycoprotein, dentine matrix protein, dentine sialoprotein, and den- tine phosphoprotein (McKee et al., 1996; Bosshardt, 2005). it has been argued that in all rodents and ruminants, cementum is a form of calcified cartilage[H&W]
