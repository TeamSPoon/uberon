 * *Label* = blood-inner ear barrier
 * *Definition* = The function of the group of barriers and transport systems which regulate the transport of various substances from blood to inner ear tissue and maintain the microhomeostasis and functional integrity of the inner ear; the endothelial cells of the inner ear blood capillaries, linked to each other by tight junctions, represent the main component of the blood-inner ear barrier [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = MP:0004999 ]
