## Class : obsolete migratory slow muscle precursor cell

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001373
 * *Label* = obsolete migratory slow muscle precursor cell
 * *Definition* = Cells that initially are located adjacent to the spinal cord and notochord along that migrate from their initial medial position radially through the myotome to the lateral surface of the somites. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ZFIN:curator ]
 * *Comment* = likely very zebrafish specific so being obsoleted for now.
