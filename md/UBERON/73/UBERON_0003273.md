## Other Annotations

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The lamprey head contains another group of muscles, the epi- and hypo-branchial muscles (EBM and HBM), derivatives of anterior trunk myotomes. (...) The origin and the migration pattern of HBM precursors are very similar to that of the gnathostome MPP, especially to that of the tongue muscle precursors. Other evidence of homology of lamprey HBM to the gnathostome tongue muscle is that HBM is innervated by the nerve termed the hypoglossal nerve based on its morphological position associated with the head/trunk interface. (...) The HBM-specific expression of the LampPax3/7 gene is consistent with the homology of this muscle to the gnathostome tongue muscle, or to the hypobranchial series as a whole (including the infrahyoid and possibly the diaphragm in mammals).[well established][VHOG]
