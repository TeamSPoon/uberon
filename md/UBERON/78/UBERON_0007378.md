 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Extraembryonic structure that serves as a nutrient store for the embryo during development.[AAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The majority of animals develop from a spherical egg with a single axis, the animal-vegetal (an-veg) axis. The animal half of the egg usually contains the nucleus of the oocyte, while the vegetal half of the egg is the preferred site for the storage of yolk. Eggs with an-veg polarity are considered ancestral for the vertebrates. Frogs, for example, have eggs with vegetally concentrated yolk and the nucleus located in the animal cytoplasm.[well established][VHOG]
