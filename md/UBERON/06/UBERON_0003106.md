## Class : urostyle

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003106
 * *Label* = urostyle
 * *Definition* = In teleosts: Anatomical cluster that is the result of fusion of preural centrum 1 with one or more adjacent ural centra[AAO]; Rodlike caudal bony structure unique to anurans that lies within a compartment formed by the elongated, anteriorly oriented pelvic girdle. The urostyle is formed by the fusion of the coccyx and the hypochord[AAO]. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = AAO:0000732, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = TAO:0000158 ]
 * *Comment* = In zebrafish, it is composed of preural vertebra 1 and ural centra 1 and 2. The number of ural centra that become fused with preural centrum 1 varies among teleost subgroups. Because of varying developmental origins the urostyle may not be homologous across species.[TAO]. Grouping with AAO dubious
