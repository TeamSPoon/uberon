 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Type of mechanoreceptive organ of the lateral line which are arranged in lines on the body surface. These organs are constituted by hair cells and supporting cells and it is located in the epidermis with its hair cells exposed to the surface. Absent in some caecilians. These receptors receive afferent and efferent innervations.[AAO]
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Volcano-shaped lateral line sensory organ located in characteristic positions within the skin epithelium and containing hair cells and their support elements. Kimmel et al, 1995. (Also see Anatomical Atlas entry for lateral line by T. Whitfield.)[TAO]
