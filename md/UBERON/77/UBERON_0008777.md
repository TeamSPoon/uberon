## Class : hypaxial musclulature

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0008777
 * *Label* = hypaxial musclulature
 * *Definition* = Musculature that is derived from the hypaxial myotome region, trunk muscles that lie ventral to the horizontal septum of the vertebrae. Hypaxial muscles include some vertebral muscles, the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles, and all limb muscles. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Epaxial_and_Hypaxial_muscles ]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: The hypaxial muscles are located on the lower side of the body, often below the horizontal septum in many species (primarily fish and amphibians). In amniotes, the positional distinctions have been lost as the body's muscles have changed through evolution, but in all species, the hypaxial muscles are innervated by the ventral ramus of the spinal nerves, while the epaxial muscles are innervated by the dorsal ramus.[WP]
