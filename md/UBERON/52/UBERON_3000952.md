## Class : posterior radial

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000952
 * *Label* = posterior radial
 * *Definition* = Paired, horn-like processes of basibranchial I that protrude in an antero-dorso-lateral direction, being more or less embedded in the tongue musculature. They arise secondarily during metamorphosis, and are therefore not strictly part of the visceral skeleton. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = AAO:Francis_1934 ]
