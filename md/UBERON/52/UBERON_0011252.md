 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011252
 * *Label* = scent gland
 * *Definition* = Scent glands are exocrine glands found in most mammals. They produce semi-viscous secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. These odor-messengers indicate information such as status, territory marking, mood, and sexual power. The odor may be subliminal—not consciously detectable. Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands may also function as scent glands in some animals. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Scent_gland ]
