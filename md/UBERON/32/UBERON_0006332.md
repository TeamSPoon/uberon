## Class : nasal capsule

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006332
 * *Label* = nasal capsule
 * *Definition* = an embryonic cartilaginous frame, the nasal capsule, an evolutionary-conserved structure composed of ventral and dorsal components: the mesethmoid and ectethmoid cartilages, respectively.[PMID]. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + PMID:21270050]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: In most mammals, the nasal capsule remains unossified, except in mammals where the ethmoid portion ossifies to form the turbinates[Kardong]. In avians, the mesethmoid supports upper beak formation, whereas the ectethmoid comprises elements of the olfactory system, including the lamina cribosa, the crista galli apophysis and the conchae. Editor's note - consider splitting this class. Developing cartilage in mammals? Connective tissue sheath in TAO. Structure that has both respiratory and olfactory functions and lies anterior to the braincase, in the foremost section of the cranium[AAO]. Cartilaginous envelope containing the nasal organ[FishBase] Multi-tissue structure composed of connective tissue that surrounds, the internal portions of the olfactory epithelium[ZFA]. Avian def: The nasal capsule is dorsoventrally divided into two parts: the upper part, the ectethmoid, serves olfaction and is composed of the lamina cribosa, the crista galli apophysis and the conchae. The lower part, the mesethmoid, is a thick cartilage bar extending from the corpus sphenoidalis to the rostral extremity of the nose (Fig. 1A-B). In the avian embryo, the mesethmoid constitutes the cartilage primordium of the upper beak
