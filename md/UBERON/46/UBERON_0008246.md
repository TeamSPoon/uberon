 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0008246
 * *Label* = pyloric stomach
 * *Definition* = The mouth of a starfish is located on the underside of the body, and opens through a short esophagus into firstly a cardiac stomach, and then, a second, pyloric stomach. Each arm also contains two pyloric caeca, long hollow tubes branching outwards from the pyloric stomach. Each pyloric caecum is lined by a series of digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine runs from the upper surface of the pyloric stomach to open at an anus in the center of the upper body [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Starfish ]
