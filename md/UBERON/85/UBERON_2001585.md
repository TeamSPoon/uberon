## Class : caudal principal ray

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001585
 * *Label* = caudal principal ray
 * *Definition* = Caudal fin lepidotrichium that is adjacent to a branched ray. Caudal principal rays may be segmented but unbranched and the main element forming the dorsal or ventral leading margin of the caudal fin or a ray that may be only segmented-and-branched and forms part of the middle-posterior region of the fin. A caudal principal ray is an unpaired median bone. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + TAO:GA_TG[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + TAO:wd]
 * *Comment* = Counts of caudal principal rays are taken as the number of branched rays plus two adjacent unbranched rays and counts are typically reported as, for example: 1,8,7,1 (1 unbranched and 8 branched upper rays, 7 branched and 1 unbranched lower rays). A caudal principal caudal ray may be associated with one or more hypurals or with hemal spines of preural centra 1 and 2 (Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 2008). In basal teleosts the number of caudal principal rays is about 20. A decreasing of the number of the branched-and segmented rays is observed in more advanced teleosts (see Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 1991, 2008).
