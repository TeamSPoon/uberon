 * *Label* = femoral pore
 * *Definition* = Femoral pores are a part of a holocrine secretory gland found on the inside of the thighs of certain lizards and amphisbaenians which releases pheromones to attract mates or mark territory. In certain species only the male has these pores and in other species, both sexes have them, with the males being larger.[1] Femoral pores appear as a series of pits or holes within a row of scales on the ventral portion of the animal's thigh.
