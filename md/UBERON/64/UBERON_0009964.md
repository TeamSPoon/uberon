## Class : crustacean maxillary gland

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0009964
 * *Label* = crustacean maxillary gland
 * *Definition* = Excretory organ in maxillary segment with duct opening on maxilla. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html ]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: consider generalizing to include millipedes, centipedes. Function: Two different excretory organs are found among crustaceans: the antennal gland and the maxillary gland. Both have the same basic structure: an end sac and a convoluted duct that may expand into a bladder before opening to the outside. In most adult crustaceans only one or the other gland functions. The functional gland may change during the life cycle. Terminology note: http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?termID=327 suggests green gland as the generic term and antennal as the decapoda term. Editor note: cede this term to Arthropod AO
