## Class : water vascular system

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0008251
 * *Label* = water vascular system
 * *Definition* = The water vascular system is a hydraulic system used by echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, for locomotion, food and waste transportation, and respiration.[1] The system is composed of canals connecting numerous tube feet. Echinoderms move by alternately contracting muscles that force water into the tube feet, causing them to extend and push against the ground, then relaxing to allow the feet to retract.[WP].
