 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011251
 * *Label* = levator claviculae muscle
 * *Definition* = A skeletal muscle in the posterior triangle of the neck. It originates on the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae and is inserted in the lateral half of the clavicle [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Levator_claviculae_muscle ]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: The levator claviculae is an infrequently recognized anatomical variant in humans, distinguished from, for example, cervical adenopathy or a thrombosed vein, but a normal muscle in lower mammals and anthropoids. In humans, when present, it often appears unilaterally, most commonly on the left side, or bilaterally.[WP]

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Cleidocervicalis is one of two muscles, which make up the cleidocephalic component of the complex brachiocephalic muscle. It is a thin triangular muscle which has a broad origin on the median raphe of the mid dorsal aspect of the neck. The muscle is bounded caudally by the trapezius and cranially by the occipital component of the sternocephalicus . The cleidocervicalis tapers as it passes ventrally across the side of the neck to insert into the clavicular tendon. It is innervated by the accessory nerve. The brachiocephalic complex advances the limb, extends the shoulder joint and fixes the neck.
