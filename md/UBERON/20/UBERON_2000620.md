## Class : autopalatine

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000620
 * *Label* = autopalatine
 * *Definition* = Endochondral bone that is part of the antero-lateral region of the palate. Commonly, it articulates with the maxilla anterolaterally and with the ethmoidal region medially. It may also articulate with the dermopalatine ventro-laterally and with the entopterygoid posteriorly. The autopalatine is paired. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ZFIN:curator ]
 * *Comment* = The cartilaginous autopalatine forms from the anterior palatoquadrate arch. Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms).
