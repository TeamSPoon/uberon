## Class : epibranchial bone uncinate process

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001382
 * *Label* = epibranchial bone uncinate process
 * *Definition* = Epibranchials 1-3 in adults are compound elements formed by the fusion of epibranchial cartilages and the so-called uncinate processes. Posteromedially directed uncinate processes develop on the posterior edge of epibranchials 1-3. These appear as separate centers of chondrification (6.2 mm) that later fuse laterally to the posterior edges of the epibranchial cartilages (6.8 mm).
