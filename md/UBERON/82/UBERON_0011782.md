 * *Comment* = The follicle consists of a series of tissue layers (from peripheral to central), including the dermis of the follicle, the epidermis of the follicle (outer epidermal layer), the follicle cavity or lumen (the space between epidermal layers), the follicle (epidermal) collar (or inner epidermal layer), and the dermal pulp (tissue at the center of the follicle). The proliferation of feather keratinocytes and most of the growth of the feather occurs in the follicle, or epidermal, collar (From: Prum 1999).
