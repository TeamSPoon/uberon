 * *[taxon_notes](../../UBPROP/08/UBPROP_0000008.md)* = Because of the phyletic continuity of the DVR in living reptiles and birds, and its numerous similarities in topography, histology, and connections in these two groups, there is little question that the DVR of reptiles and birds is homologous as a telencephalic neural center. In contrast, the telencephalon in living mammals does not appear to have a DVR. It has been suggested, however, that their predecessors did have such a ridge, and that its cells migrated to the surface of the telencephalon during development to form part of the cerebral cortices which characterize all living mammals (Karten, 1969, 1991)[http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/4/743.full]
