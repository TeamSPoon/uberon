## Class : olfactory glomerulus

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005387
 * *Label* = olfactory glomerulus
 * *Definition* = One of the small globular masses of dense neuropil in the olfactory bulb, containing the first synapse in the olfactory pathway[BTO]. a spherical structure located in the olfactory bulb of the brain where the synapses form between the olfactory nerve terminals and dendrites of mitral, periglomerular and tufted cells. Each glomerulus is surrounded by periglomerular neurons and glial cells which gives it an oval shape.[1][2] All glomeruli are located near the surface of the olfactory bulb. In mammals, glomeruli typically range between 50-120 µm in diameter and number between 1800 and 2400 depending on the species.[1][2] Each glomerulus is composed of two compartments, the olfactory nerve zone and the non-olfactory nerve zone. The olfactory nerve zone is composed of preterminals and terminals of the olfactory nerve and is where the olfactory receptor cells make synapses on their targets.[2] The non-olfactory nerve zone is composed of the dendritic processes of intrinsic neurons and is where dendrodendritic interactions between intrinsic neurons occur.[2] It is the first site for synaptic processing of odor information coming from the nose. It is made up of a globular tangle of axons from the olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium, and dendrites from the mitral cell as well as from juxtaglomerular cells that include tufted cells, periglomerular cells, short axon cells, and astrocytes[WP].
