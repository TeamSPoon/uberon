## Class : undifferentiated genital tubercle

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005876
 * *Label* = undifferentiated genital tubercle
 * *Definition* = A genital tubercle is a body of tissue present in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. It forms in the ventral, caudal region of mammalian embryos of both sexes, and eventually develops into a phallus. In the human fetus the genital tubercle develops around week 4 of gestation, and by week 9 becomes recognizably either a clitoris or penis. This should not be confused with the sinus tubercle which is a proliferation of endoderm induced by paramesonephic ducts. Even after the phallus is developed, the term genital tubercle remains, but only as the terminal end of it[2], which develops into either the glans penis or the glans clitoridis. The genital tubercle is sensitive to dihydrotestosterone and rich in 5-alpha-reductase, so that the amount of fetal testosterone present after the second month is a major determinant of phallus size at birth.[WP].

 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: todo - add taxon constraints. AO notes: we assume the EMAPA class is the undifferentiated form based on TS timings

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The eminence in the embryo which develops into the clitoris or penis. [TFD][VHOG]
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = embryonic anlage of the external genitalia, which emerges as paired swellings ventral to the cloacal membrane, is proposed to be derived from all three germ layers, and gives rise to the penis, clitoris, scrotum, labia, and foreskin; GT development is indistinguishable in male and female mouse embryos until ~E16, when the urethral plate begins to be masculinized to form the penile urethra, marking the beginning of an androgen-dependent phase of sexual differentiation[MP]
