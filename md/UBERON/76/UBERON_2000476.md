## Class : branchiostegal ray

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000476
 * *Label* = branchiostegal ray
 * *Definition* = Dermal bone that is a flattened element that supports the branchiostegal membrane. Branchiostegal rays are generally present in a series articulating ventrally or ventro-medially with the anterior and posterior ceratobranchials whereas the most posterior ray articulates with the subopercle. The branchiostegal ray is paired. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ZFIN:curator ]
 * *Comment* = Although the branchiostegals are articulated or attached to the hyoid arch, they belong to the opercular series. Branchiostegal rays are of variable shape and number and their homology is problematic. Usually they are numbered from anterior to posterior elements, instead from posterior to anteriorly considering that the last element of the series is consistently associated to the subopercle. For a survey of branchiostegal rays see Mc Allister (1968).
