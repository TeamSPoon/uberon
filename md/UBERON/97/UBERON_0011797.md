 * *[definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md)* = A remex feather that is connected to the ulna.
 * *[taxon_notes](../../UBPROP/08/UBPROP_0000008.md)* = In some species, the ligaments that bind these remiges to the bone connect to small, rounded projections, known as quill knobs, on the ulna; in other species, no such knobs exist. Secondary feathers remain close together in flight (they cannot be individually separated like the primaries can) and help to provide lift by creating the airfoil shape of the bird's wing. Secondaries tend to be shorter and broader than primaries, with blunter ends
