## Class : endochondral scleral ossicle

 * *Label* = endochondral scleral ossicle
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: The scleral ossicles [of teleosts] are reported to form indirectly by endochondral (Hall and Miyake, 1992) or by perichondral ossification (Patterson, 1977) from a cartilage element that is also present in the sclera. This is unlike the scleral ossicles of reptiles, which develop directly from ectomesenchyme (i.e., intramembranous ossification) and independently from the scleral cartilage[PMID:17051547]
