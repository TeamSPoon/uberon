 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001630
 * *Label* = muscle organ
 * *Definition* = Organ consisting of a tissue made up of various elongated cells that are specialized to contract and thus to produce movement and mechanical work[GO]. Nonparenchymatous organ that primarily consists of skeletal muscle tissue aggregated into macroscopic fasciculi by connective tissue; together with other muscles, it constitutes the muscular system. Examples: biceps, diaphragm, masseter, right third external intercostal muscle, external oblique, levator ani, serratus anterior[FMA].

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Portion of tissue composed of contractile fibers.[TAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = It seems clear that the metazoan ancestor inherited from its unicellular descendants an actin cytoskeleton and motor-proteins of the myosin superfamily. Within metazoans, these two molecules were arranged into effective contractile units, the muscles. The basic trends for muscle evolution are already expressed in the diploblastic taxa.[well established][VHOG]
