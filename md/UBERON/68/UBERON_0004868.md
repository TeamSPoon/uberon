## Class : tapetum lucidum

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004868
 * *Label* = tapetum lucidum
 * *Definition* = a layer of tissue in the eye of many vertebrate animals, that lies immediately behind or sometimes within the retina. It reflects visible light back through the retina, increasing the light available to the photoreceptors [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + PMID:14738502[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + Wikipedia:Tapetum_lucidum]
 * *Comment* = Function notes: It normally functions at low light levels to provide the light-sensitive retinal cells with a second opportunity for photon-photoreceptor stimulation, thereby enhancing visual sensitivity

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The tapetum lucidum is a biologic reflector system that is a common feature in the eyes of vertebrates. Typically absent in diurnal animals. In vertebrates, the tapetum lucidum exhibits diverse structure, organization and composition. The tapetum lucidum represents a remarkable example of neural cell and tissue specialization as an adaptation to a dim light environment and, despite these differences, all tapetal variants act to increase retinal sensitivity by reflecting light back through the photoreceptor layer. These variations regarding both its location and structure, as well as the choice of reflective material, may represent selective visual adaptations associated with their feeding behavior, in response to the use of specific wavelengths and amount of reflectance required.[PMID:14738502].
 * *[has_relational_adjective](../../UBPROP/07/UBPROP_0000007.md)* = tapetal
 * *[taxon_notes](../../UBPROP/08/UBPROP_0000008.md)* = Two morphologic types of tapetum lucidum can be observed in the eyes of fish: one in the choroid that occurs in elasmobranchs, and the other which occurs in teleosts and lies in the pigment epithelium of the retina
