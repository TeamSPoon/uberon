## Class : neural rod

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005068
 * *Label* = neural rod
 * *Definition* = A solid rod of neurectoderm derived from the neural keel. The neural rod is roughly circular in cross section. Neural rod formation occurs during primary neurulation in teleosts[GO]. An intermediate stage in the development of the central nervous system present during the segmentation period; the neural rod is roughly cylindrical in shape, forms from the neural keel, and is not yet hollowed out into the neural tube[ZFIN].
