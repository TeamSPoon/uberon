 * *[core#provenance_notes](../../core#provenance/es/core#provenance_notes.md)* = This class was sourced from an external ontology (amphibian_anatomy). It was modified by cjm in the following way: the class was relabeled from "prepollex" to "prepollex skeleton", to distinguish it from the digit-like structure which it is a part of. It was re-classified from "bone" to "subdivision of skeleton", as it may in fact be composed of multiple individual bones. TODO: definition needs reviewed, and it still requires placement under the UBERON:0012136 ! prehallux
