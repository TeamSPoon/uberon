## Class : cervix squamous epithelium

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006922
 * *Label* = cervix squamous epithelium
 * *Definition* = The squamous epithelium of the cervical portio is similar to that of the vagina, except that it is generally smooth and lacks rete pegs. Colposcopically, it appears featureless except for a fine network of vessels which is sometimes visible. The relative opacity and pale pink coloration of the squamous epithelium derives from its multi-layered histology and the location of its supporting vessels below the basement membrane.
