## Class : transverse tarsal joint

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011962
 * *Label* = transverse tarsal joint
 * *Definition* = The transverse tarsal joint is formed by the articulation of the calcaneus with the cuboid, and the articulation of the talus with the navicular. The movement which takes place in this joint is more extensive than that in the other tarsal joints, and consists of a sort of rotation by means of which the foot may be slightly flexed or extended, the sole being at the same time carried medially (inverted) or laterally.
