## Class : cloaca

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000162
 * *Label* = cloaca
 * *Definition* = Common chamber into which the intestines and excretory system opens. Arises during development in all vertebrates, but in many it becomes subdivided, lost or incorporated into other structures [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = ISBN10:0073040584, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Cloaca ]
 * *Comment* = Development notes: hindgut endoderm and proctodeal ectoderm. Taxon notes: Human beings only have an embryonic cloaca, which is split up into separate tracts during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs[WP]. Editor notes: adding df link to embryonic cloaca leads to a cycle in uberon-simple, as cloaca is a suberclass of embryonic cloaca
