## Class : pelvic cartilage

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_4300016
 * *Label* = pelvic cartilage
 * *Definition* = Cartilage element associated with the pelvic fin in aulopiform fishes.
 * *Comment* = Paralepidids (except Anotopterus), Alepisaurus, and evermannellids have a well-developed cartilage that extends dorsally into the body musculature from the region where the lateral pelvic-fin rays articulate with the girdle. In some young specimens, this cartilage is attached by a small rod of cartilage to the cartilage capping the central process, suggesting that it originates as part of the lateral cartilage. A similar cartilage is present in myctophids (Fig. 4A) but lacking in other aulopiforms and outgroups. [From Baldwin CC & Johnson GD (1996) Interrelationships of Aulopiformes.
