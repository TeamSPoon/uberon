 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000716
 * *Label* = acoelous
 * *Definition* = Vertebral centrum with flat ends. Between successive vertebrae there is a fibrocartilaginous intervertebral body with a gel-like core, the nucleus pulposus, which is derived from the embryonic notochord. Acoelous vertebrae seem especially suited to receive and distribute compressive forces within the vertebral column. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + AAO:LAP]
