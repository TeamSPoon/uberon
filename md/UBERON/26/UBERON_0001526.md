 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: Amphibians - def: "Muscle of the forearm: It shares a common origin with two other muscles of the forearm. It arises from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus by two tendons: the first one is in common with the m. extensor digitorum communis longus, and the second one is broad and in common with the m. epicondylocubitalis. It is pinnately attached to the dorsal surface of the distal carpal 5-4-3." [AAO:0010281]. Note that we make the insertion relationship a GCI until digit numbering issues are resolved
