 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011823
 * *Label* = dense connective tissue
 * *Definition* = Dense connective tissue is mainly composed of collagen type I. Crowded between the collagen fibers are rows of fibroblasts, fiber-forming cells, that manufacture the fibers. Dense connective tissue forms strong, rope-like structures such as tendons and ligaments. Tendons attach skeletal muscles to bones; ligaments connect bones to bones at joints. Ligaments are more stretchy and contain more elastic fibers than tendons. Dense connective tissue also make up the lower layers of the skin (dermis), where it is arranged in sheets [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Dense_connective_tissue ]
