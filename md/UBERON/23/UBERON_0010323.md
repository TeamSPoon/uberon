## Class : cranial skeletal system

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010323
 * *Label* = cranial skeletal system
 * *Definition* = Skeletal subdivision of the head including skull (cranium plus mandible), pharyngeal and/or hyoid apparatus. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO_REF:0000034, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PSPUB:0000170, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = VSAO:0000049, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051070 ]
 * *Comment* = Note that the cranial skeleton includes the pharyngeal arch skeleton. It is thus more inclusive that the cranium itself, and extends beyond the head in tetrapods. The AAO class called 'skull' belongs here, as it includes the whole splanchnocranium. Editor notes: we use 'cranial skeletal system', so that we can include the skull, which has joints/sutures as parts (recall, we follow FMA in distinguishing between the skeleton and skeletal system - only the latter includes joints)
