 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = White matter structure of CNS that contains axons that arise predominantly in one central nervous system part and terminate in another. Tracts are generally named by their region or origin followed by their region of primary termination, e.g., mammillothalamic tract contains axons that arise from neurons in the mammillary bodies and terminate in the thalamus.
