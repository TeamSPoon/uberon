## Class : jugular lymph sac

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011765
 * *Label* = jugular lymph sac
 * *Definition* = Lymphatic vessels develop from lymph sacs that arise from developing veins, which are derived from mesoderm. The first lymph sacs to appear are the paired jugular lymph sacs at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins.

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = Lymph hearts are pulsatile organs, present in lower vertebrates, that function to propel lymph into the venous system. Although they are absent in mammals, the initial veno-lymphatic plexus that forms during mammalian jugular lymph sac development has been described as the vestigial homologue of the nascent stage of ancestral anterior lymph hearts.[well established][VHOG]
