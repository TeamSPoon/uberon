 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Ectomesenchyme has similar properties to mesenchyme. The major difference is that ectomesenchyme is usually considered to arise from neural crest cells, which are a critical group of cells that form in the cranial region during early vertebrate development. Thus, ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth, and, most important, the branchial arches[Wikipedia:Ectomesenchyme].
