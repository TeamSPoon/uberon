 * *[definition](../../IAO/15/IAO_0000115.md)* = mesenchymal cells derived from neural crest cells that contribute to development of the hard and soft tissue in the head and neck, including the branchial arches[MP].
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Ectomesenchyme has similar properties to mesenchyme. The major difference is that ectomesenchyme is usually considered to arise from neural crest cells, which are a critical group of cells that form in the cranial region during early vertebrate development. Thus, ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth, and, most important, the branchial arches[Wikipedia:Ectomesenchyme].
 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Portion of tissue that develops from the cranial neural crest and which cells populate a series of pharyngeal arches from which develops the support skeleton of the jaw and gills[ZFA:0005771].
