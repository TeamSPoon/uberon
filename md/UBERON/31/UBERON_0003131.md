## Class : arthropod tibia

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003131
 * *Label* = arthropod tibia
 * *Definition* = A section of the arthropod leg. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Arthropod_leg ]
 * *Comment* = Editor notes: this term should be ceded to the arthropod anatomy ontology. Homology notes: homology of leg segments between groups are difficult to prove and are the source of much argument. Some authors posit up to eleven segments per leg for the most recent common ancestor of extant arthropods [1], but modern arthropods have eight or fewer. It has been argued [2][3] that the ancestral leg need not have been so complex, and that other events, such as the successive loss of function of a Hox-gene could result in parallel gains of leg segments.
