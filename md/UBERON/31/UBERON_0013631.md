 * *Label* = sesamoid element
 * *Definition* = Ossicle that develops within bands of dense, regular connective tissue (e.g., tendons and ligaments). Sesamoids are generally located proximate to a bony prominence, over which the dense regular connective tissue wraps, and/or a joint or articulation. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PSPUB:0000169, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = VSAO:0000137 ]
 * *Comment* = Sesamoids are often endochondral replacement elements and in addition to bone tissue, may also be composed of articular cartilage, fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage, and calcified cartilage.
