 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001050
 * *Label* = obsolete atrium
 * *Comment* = obsoleted because 'atrium' as a general grouping class that encompasses the cardiac atrium and atrium of alveolus atrium is of questionable value. Furthermore, the use of the term 'atrium' in the generic sense is misleading, as this is commonly used to refer specifically to the cardiac atrium
