 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Anatomical system of ion binding, a pumping mechanism, and an efficient vascular system; consisting of the blood, heart, and blood and lymph vessels, respectively.[AAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = We should divest ourselves of the view that earlier vertebrate groups were 'on their way' to becoming mammals, as clearly they were not such visionaries. Neither were their systems 'imperfect' as earlier anatomists thought. Instead, their circulatory systems served them well to address the ecological demands arising from their lifestyles.[well established][VHOG]
