## Class : epural

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000660
 * *Label* = epural
 * *Definition* = A free, modified neural spine of a preural or a ural vertebra that is placed between the last developed neural spine of a preural centrum and the dorsal axis (= anterior margin of first uroneural) of the caudal skeleton . An epural commonly supports one or more dorsal procurrent rays. An epural is an unpaired median perichondrally ossified bone. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = TAO:Arratia and Schultze_1992 ]
 * *Comment* = The origin of the epurals is unclear, three hypotheses have been proposed: 1) The epurals are modified radials or dorsal radials; 2) the epurals are detached neural spines and may support fin rays; and 3) the epurals are a serial homologue of the supraneuralia. At least in teleosts the epural is a detached neural spine. For details see Schultze and Arratia (1989) and Arratia and Schultze (1992).
