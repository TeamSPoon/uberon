 * *Label* = articular capsule of glenohumeral joint
 * *Definition* = The articular capsule of the humerus is the articular capsule of the shoulder joint. It completely encircles the joint, being attached, above, to the circumference of the glenoid cavity beyond the glenoidal labrum; below, to the anatomical neck of the humerus, approaching nearer to the articular cartilage above than in the rest of its extent. It is thicker above and below than elsewhere, and is so remarkably loose and lax, that it has no action in keeping the bones in contact, but allows them to be separated from each other more than 2.5 cm. , an evident provision for that extreme freedom of movement which is peculiar to this articulation. It is strengthened, above, by the Supraspinatus; below, by the long head of the Triceps brachii; behind, by the tendons of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor; and in front, by the tendon of the Subscapularis.[WP,unvetted] [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Articular_capsule_of_the_humerus ]
