 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0012115
 * *Label* = dental comb
 * *Definition* = a dental structure found in some mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + Wikipedia:Toothcomb]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes:  The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates (which includes lemurs and lorisoids), treeshrews, colugos, hyraxes, and some African antelopes. The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first premolar. The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple tines per tooth
