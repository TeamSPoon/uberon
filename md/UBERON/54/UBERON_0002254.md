## Class : thyroglossal duct

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002254
 * *Label* = thyroglossal duct
 * *Definition* = The thyroglossal duct is an embryological anatomical structure forming an open connection between the initial area of development of the thyroid gland and its final position. The thyroid gland starts developing in the oropharynx in the fetus and descends to its final position taking a path through the tongue, hyoid bone and neck muscles. The connection between its original position and its final position is the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally atrophies and closes off before birth but can remain open in some people.

 * *Comment* = FMA treats this as vestigial

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = An embryonic duct extending between the thyroid primordium and the posterior tongue. [TFD][VHOG]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = A duct, called the thyroglossal duct in mammals, is considered to be characteristic of thyroid development. The thyroglossal duct, degenerating in many species during late development, marks the way the thyroid primordium relocates during embryonic development from the pharynx to its position deep in the cervical mesenchyme. We cannot exclude that the duct of the endostyle and the thyroglossal duct may have evolved independently, but as they both represent a more or less persistent connection of the organ to the pharynx, it is likely that they are homologous structures.[well established][VHOG]
