## Class : roof plate

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003054
 * *Label* = roof plate
 * *Definition* = a single row of glia at the dorsal midline of the developing neural tube along the entire anterior-posterior axis. This region provides inductive signals for the specification of neuronal cell types and of the specification of neural crest cells. The cells comprising the roof plate are the precursors to radial glial cells. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = GO:0021509, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PMID:15378040 ]
 * *Comment* = TODO - Note that although this is classically defined as being located on the neural tube, in many AOs the roof plate continues post-embryonically after the neural tube has ceased to exist. Consider 'roof plate of neural tube'. TODO - alar plate vs roof plate
