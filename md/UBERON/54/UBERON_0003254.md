 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003254
 * *Label* = amniotic ectoderm
 * *Comment* = Editor note: we make the germ layer relationship develops_from, as currently the germ layers are declared to be purely embryonic. TODO - check. WP:Amnion - In the human embryo the earliest stages of the formation of the amnion have not been observed; in the youngest embryo which has been studied the amnion was already present as a closed sac, and appears in the inner cell-mass as a cavity. This cavity is roofed in by a single stratum of flattened, ectodermal cells, the amniotic ectoderm, and its floor consists of the prismatic ectoderm of the embryonic disk—the continuity between the roof and floor being established at the margin of the embryonic disk. Outside the amniotic ectoderm is a thin layer of mesoderm, which is continuous with that of the somatopleure and is connected by the body-stalk with the mesodermal lining of the chorion.
