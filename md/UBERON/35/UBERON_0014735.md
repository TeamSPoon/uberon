## Class : paleocortex

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0014735
 * *Label* = paleocortex
 * *Definition* = Paleocortex is a type of cortical tissue that consists of either four or five cortical laminae (layers of neuronal cell bodies). It has fewer laminae than neocortex, which has six, but more than archicortex, which has three. Paleocortex, along with archicortex and periallocortex, is a type of allocortex. Because the number of laminae that compose a type of cortical tissue seems to be directly proportional to both the information-processing capabilities of that tissue and its phylogenetic age, paleocortex is thought to be an intermediate between neocortex and archicortex in both aspects.

 * *Comment* = Location notes: Paleocortex is present in the parahippocampal gyrus,[1] olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, periamygdalar area,[2] anterior olfactory nucleus, anterior perforated substance, and prepyriform area[WP]
