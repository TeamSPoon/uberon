## Class : subplate

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004035
 * *Label* = subplate
 * *Definition* = the transient outer neural tube region that contains the first generated post-mitotic neurons that receive synaptic input from thalamic axons and in turn project axons to the developing cortical plate [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = MP:0008440, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Subplate, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = https://github.com/obophenotype/mouse-anatomy-ontology/issues/1 ]
 * *Comment* = The transient fetal subplate zone, together with the marginal zone and the cortical plate, represents the developmental anlage of the mammalian cerebral cortex. It serves as a waiting compartment for growing cortical afferents; its cells are involved in the establishment of pioneering cortical efferent projections and transient fetal circuitry, and apparently have a number of other developmental roles. The subplate zone is a phylogenetically recent structure and it is most developed in the human brain. Subplate neurons are among the first generated neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex [1]. These neurons disappear during postnatal development and are important in establishing the correct wiring [2][3] and functional maturation [4] of the cerebral cortex. Subplate neurons appear to be selectively sensitive to injury (such as hypoxia) which in humans are associated with motor and cognitive defects[WP].
