## Class : trabecula carnea

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002511
 * *Label* = trabecula carnea
 * *Definition* = The trabeculae carneae (columnae carneae, or fleshy beams), are rounded or irregular muscular columns which project from the inner surface of the right and left ventricles of the heart.[1] They should not be confused with the pectinate muscles, which are present in the right[1] and left atria only. They are of three kinds: * some are attached along their entire length on one side and merely form prominent ridges,* others are fixed at their extremities but free in the middle, * while a third set, the papillary muscles are continuous by their bases with the wall of the ventricle, while their apices give origin to the chord¾ tendine¾ which pass to be attached to the segments of both the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. The purpose of the trabeculae carneae is most likely to prevent suction that would occur with a flat surfaced membrane and thus impair the heart's ability to pump efficiently. The trabeculae carneae also serve a similar function to papillary muscles in that their contraction pulls on the chordae tendineae, preventing inversion of the mitral (bicuspid) and tricuspid valves, that is, their bulging towards the atrial chambers, which would lead to subsequent leakage of the blood into the atria. So by the action of papillary muscles on the atrioventricular valves, backflow of the blood from the ventricles into the atria is prevented[WP].

 * *Comment* = Note that WP states they are ventricular, but MP has classes for atrial ventricular carnea.
