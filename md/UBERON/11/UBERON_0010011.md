## Class : collection of basal ganglia

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010011
 * *Label* = collection of basal ganglia
 * *Definition* = Subcortical masses of gray matter in the forebrain and midbrain that are richly interconnected and so viewed as a functional system. The nuclei usually included are the caudate nucleus (caudoputamen in rodents), putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra (pars compacta and pars reticulata) and the subthalamic nucleus. Some also include the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = NIF_GrossAnatomy:birnlex_826 ]
 * *Comment* = Editor note: it is necessary to introduce two classes, one representing an individual basal ganglion, another representing the aggregate structure, in order to have consistent classification amongst AOs (e.g. in MA the aygdala is part of the BG, in FMA and BTO it is a subclass). Apart from achieving this consistency, the value of having two distinct classes is questionable, since the BG-plural is trivially the collection of all BGs-singular.  it would be better for all AOs to decide on one single way of doing this. Do not merge until this is done.
