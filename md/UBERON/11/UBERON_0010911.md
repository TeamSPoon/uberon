## Class : ossicle

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010911
 * *Label* = ossicle
 * *Definition* = Skeletal element that is often isolated, small, and variable in composition. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PSPUB:0000169, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = VSAO:0000132 ]
 * *Comment* = Ossicles are composed of a combination skeletal tissues, including bone, calcified cartilage, hyaline cartilage, etc, and exhibit variable development across species. Ossicles are not necessarily jointed, and examples include the menisci of synovial joints, 'Panda's thumb' (radial sesamoid), cardiac skeletal elements, sclerotic bones, middle ear ossicles, and sesamoids.
