## Class : intromittent organ

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0008811
 * *Label* = intromittent organ
 * *Definition* = an external organ of a male organism that is specialized to deliver sperm during copulation. Intromittent organs are found most often in terrestrial species, as most aquatic species fertilize their eggs externally, although there are exceptions[WP]. [[database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) =  + Wikipedia:Intromittent_organ]
 * *Comment* = this is a broad grouping class connecting a number of different analagous organs by their function. We place the insect aedeagus here rather than penis, although this is somewhat arbitrary given the broadness of the current definition
