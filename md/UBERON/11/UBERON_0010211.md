 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010211
 * *Label* = granulation tissue
 * *Definition* = Highly vascularized tissue that replaces the initial fibrin clot in a wound. Vascularization is by ingrowth of capillary endothelium from the surrounding vasculature. The tissue is also rich in fibroblasts (that will eventually produce the fibrous tissue) and leucocytes. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = BTO:0003257 ]
