 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The tendon of the ambiens muscle passes obliquely over the knee joint. It assists in the control of the bird’s toes. This muscle is present in some reptiles but not mammals. It is present in caiques and some other South American genera, but missing in most parrot genera. This was first noted by Garrod (1874) who proposed using this and other anatomical differences to classify parrots.
