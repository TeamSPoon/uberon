## Class : cerumen gland

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0013211
 * *Label* = cerumen gland
 * *Definition* = A specialized sudoriferous gland (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in the external auditory canal. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in the external auditory canal. Here they produce cerumen, or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells. Cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans the external auditory canal, waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, and serves as a barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores, etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.
