## Class : clavicle

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001105
 * *Label* = clavicle
 * *Definition* = A paired dermal or endochondral bone that is part of the pectoral girdle. The clavicle may be in contact with the interclavicle or coracoid and forms an attachment site for pectoral musculature. [PHENOSCAPE:ad]. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = PHENOSCAPE:ad ]
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes: The clavicle first appears as part of the skeleton in primitive bony fish, where it is associated with the pectoral fin; they also have a bone called the cleithrum. In such fish, the paired clavicles run behind and below the gills on each side, and are joined by a solid symphysis on the fish's underside. They are, however, absent in cartilagenous fish and in the vast majority of living bony fish, including all of the teleosts[ISBN 0-03-910284-X] AO Notes: FMA and MA differ in whether they consider this part of the shoulder. Development notes: In most birds and mammals the clavicles are the only dermal elements in the trunk, and is the only membrane bone associated with the pectoral girdle in these taxa. However, there can be secondary cartilage, or subsequent endochondral ossification, or fusion with endochondral elements. In rodents, the lateral ends of the clavicle are endochondral but the main portion is dermal.[ISBN:978-0-12-319060-4]

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = In early tetrapods, the connecting skull bone, the posttemporal, and adjoining shoulder bones, supracleithrum and postcleithrum (=anocleithrum), are absent, leaving a dermal shoulder girdle composed of the remaining ventral elements: the paired cleithrum and clavicle, and an unpaired midventral interclavicle that joins both halves of the girdle across the midline. (...) Several dermal elements of the shoulder persist in early synapsids. The clavicle and interclavicle are present in therapsids and monotremes, but in marsupials and placentals, the interclavicle is absent, the clavicle often is reduced in size, and the scapula becomes the predominant shoulder element.[well established][VHOG]
