## Class : trunk neural crest

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003083
 * *Label* = trunk neural crest
 * *Definition* = Trunk portion of the neural crest. The trunk neural crest lies between the vagal and sacral neural crest and gives rise to two groups of cells. One group migrates dorsolateral and populates the skin, forming pigment cells and the other migrates ventrolateral through the anterior sclerotome to become the epinephrine-producing cells of the adrenal gland and the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. Some cells remain in the sclerotome to form the dorsal root ganglia [Wikipedia].
