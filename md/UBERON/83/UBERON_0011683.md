 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011683
 * *Label* = adductor mandibulae
 * *Definition* = An adductor muscle that acts on the jaw. In some species, this is subdivided into segments based on attachment. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = UBERON:cjm ]

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Is a mandibular muscle that forms along the palatoquadrates and inserts on Meckel's cartilages and functions in jaw closing[ZFA:0007049].
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The division of the adductor mandibulae in the various lines of tetrapod evolution correlates with divergences in their methods of feeding. (...) As the jaws become stronger and their movements more complex in the line of evolution toward mammals, the adductor complex becomes divided into several distinct muscles (temporalis, masseter, pterygoideus, tensor tympani, tensor veli palati).[well established][VHOG]
 * *[taxon_notes](../../UBPROP/08/UBPROP_0000008.md)* = In teleosts, the complex is composed of several derived muscles that attach to different parts of the highly kinetic skull.
