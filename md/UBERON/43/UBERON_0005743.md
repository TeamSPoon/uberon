 * *[external_ontology_notes](../../UBPROP/12/UBPROP_0000012.md)* = this class was originally added to account for some definitions of the CNS that includes retina. Most existing AOs use CNS to exclude the retina (ZFA retina NOT part_of CNS. XAO excludes retina in text def, retina (previously) part_of CNS. MA retina NOT part_of CNS. NIF_GA retina NOT part_of CNS. Fly also excludes it. EFO also excludes it. GO also excludes it). Whilst logically valid, the use case is better served by following the developmental relationships for retina.
