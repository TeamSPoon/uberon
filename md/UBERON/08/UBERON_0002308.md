 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002308
 * *Label* = nucleus of brain
 * *Definition* = Nucleus of neuraxis which is located within the brain. Example: pontobulbar nucleus, globose nucleus[FMA]. brain structure consisting of a relatively compact cluster of neurons. It is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell organization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or cerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of gray matter, often bordered by white matter. The vertebrate brain contains hundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size. A nucleus may itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons arranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers.[Wikipedia] [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = FMA:83840, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Nucleus_(neuroanatomy) ]
