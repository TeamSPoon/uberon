<b>CJM-NOTES:</b> VAO uses "odontogenic papilla" instead of "dental papilla". This is a better name to use in a pan-vertebrate context, although there is a case for splitting the class (e.g. dental papilla is an odontogenetic papilla that is part of a developing tooth)

<p>
  <i>
<b>CJM-NOTES: </b>
Here we start getting into some crucial differences. Uberon has separate classes for "skeleton" and "skeletal system", the former is part of the latter, with classes such as "axial skeleton" part of the skeleton. The skeletal system is divided into the skeleton and articular system (following FMA). Uberon also goes up to "musculoskeletal system", which is skeletal system + muscular system

 Uberon has the following path for terms such as PC axial skeleton:
<pre>
- UBERON:0002204 ! musculoskeletal system
-- UBERON:0001434 ! skeletal system *** 
--- UBERON:0004288 ! skeleton *** 
---- UBERON:0005944 ! axial skeleton *** 
----- UBERON:0002090 ! postcranial axial skeleton *** 
</pre>
 This is similar to the FMA.
  </i>
</p>
<i>
<p>
                
               In contrast, VAO has no term "skeleton". The VAO def
                of "skeletal system" is under-specified. Also VAO
                doesn't go up to "musculoskeletal system".

<pre>
- VAO:0000027 ! skeletal system
-- VAO:0000035 ! dermal skeleton *** 
--- VAO:0000090 ! integumentary skeleton *** 
-- VAO:0000037 ! endoskeleton *** 
-- VAO:0000056 ! axial skeleton *** 
--- VAO:0000049 ! cranial skeleton *** 
--- VAO:0000093 ! postcranial axial skeleton *** 
-- VAO:0000076 ! appendicular skeleton *** 
</pre>
              </p>
<p>
                  Recommendation: adopt the FMA/uberon
                  distinction. Some work migh need done on the
                  articular system and how this relates to
                  cartilaginous skeletons (note VAO doesn't have any
                  terms for joints or articular elements).

The notochord should not be confused with the backbone or vertebral column of most adult vertebrates. The notochord appears early in embryogeny and plays an important role in promoting or organizing the embryonic development of nearby structures. In most adult chordates the notochord disappears or becomes highly modified. In some non-vertebrate chordates and fishes the notochord persists as a laterally flexible but incompressible skeletal rod that prevents telescopic collapse of the body during swimming[TOLWEB]. a flexible, rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It is </ins>composed of <ins>cells derived from the mesoderm </ins>and <ins>defines the primitive axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the vertebral body of the vertebral column. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube. The notochord is composed primarily of a core of glycoproteins, encased in a sheath of collagen fibers wound into two opposing helices. The angle between these fibers determines whether increased pressure in the core will result in shortening and thickening versus lengthening and thinning[WP].</ins></span></p>

Qualifiers like "usually" are better kept in the definition gloss if
possible. Can we reference the GO process in the definition
here. Also, there's nothing in the definition saying this is a bone;
in fact one major difference between VAO and UBR is that VAO has no
term "bone" - it lumps bone (organ) and bone tissue together. See Fig
2 of my pre-skeletal meeting white paper for more details here. Uberon
is likely to keep the distinction between bone and bone tissue.
